# Definition

Stellar magnitudes measured from a photographic plate exposed without
filters. Photographic plates are more sensitive to short wavelengths
than the human eye. The zero point of the photographic magnitude scale
is such that photographic (mpg) and visual (mv) magnitudes are the same
for stars of class A0 of magnitudes between 5.5 and 6.5. Photovisual
magnitudes (mpv) are measured from plates exposed through filters which
hold back blue and violet thus giving magnitudes in the plate which
closely approximate visual magnitudes (mv).
