# Definition

A tube formed in space by the intersection of unit-interval isotimic
surfaces of two scalar quantities. Solenoids formed by the intersection
of surfaces of equal pressure and density are frequently referred to in
meteorology. A barotropic atmosphere implies the absence of solenoids of
this type, since surfaces of equal pressure and density coincide.
