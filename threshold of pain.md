# Definition

In acoustics, for a specified signal, the minimum effective sound
pressure level of that signal which, in a specified fraction of the
trials, will stimulate the ear to a point at which the discomfort gives
way to definite pain that is distinct from mere non-noxious feeling of
discomfort. The term applies similarly for other senses.
