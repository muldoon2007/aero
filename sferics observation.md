# Definition

An evaluation, from one or more sferics receivers, of the location of
weather conditions with which lightning is associated. Such observations
are more commonly obtained from networks of two or three widely spaced
stations. Simultaneous observations of the azimuth of the discharge are
made at all stations and the location of the storm is determined by
triangulation.
