# Definition

Eluding precise prediction, completely irregular. Compare stochastic. In
connection with probability and statistics, the term random implies
collective or long-run regularity; thus, a long record of the behavior
of a random phenomenon presumably gives a fair indication of its general
behavior in another long record, although the individual observations
have no discernible system of progression.
