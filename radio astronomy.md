# Definition

1.  The study of celestial objects through observation of radiofrequency
    waves emitted or reflected by these objects. In this sense radio
    astronomy includes both the use of radiation emitted by the
    celestial bodies and of radiation originating on earth and reflected
    by celestial bodies (radar astronomy). 2. Specifically, the study of
    celestial objects by measurement of the radiation emitted by them in
    the radiofrequency range of the electromagnetic spectrum. Radio
    astronomy measurements are usually of the intensity of the received
    signal but often include polarization of the signal and angular size
    of the source.
