# Definition

That branch of meteorology which deals with optical, electrical,
acoustical, and thermodynamic phenomena of atmospheres, their chemical
composition, the laws of radiation, and the explanation of clouds and
precipitation. As generally accepted, it does not include mathematical
theory of the motions of the atmosphere and the forces responsible
therefore (which matters fall in the field of dynamic meteorology). Also
called atmospheric physics. Subdivisions of physical meteorology include
atmospheric electricity, cloud physics, precipitation physics,
atmospheric acoustics, and atmospheric optics.
