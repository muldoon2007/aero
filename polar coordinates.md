# Definition

1.  In a plane, a system of curvilinear coordinates in which a point is
    located by its distance r from the origin (or pole) and by the angle
    θ which a line (radius vector) joining the given point and the
    origin makes with a fixed reference line, called the polar axis. The
    relations between rectangular Cartesian coordinates and polar
    coordinates are x = r cos θ, y = r sin θ, r2 = x2 + y2 where the
    origins of the two systems coincide and the polar axis coincides
    with the X-axis. 2. In three dimensions, short for space polar
    coordinates.
