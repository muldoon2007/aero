# Definition

1.  An elemental path of radiated energy; or the energy following this
    path. It is perpendicular to the phase fronts of the radiation. See
    incident ray, reflected ray, refracted ray. 2. One of a series of
    lines diverging from a common point, as radii from the center of a
    circle. 3. A long, narrow, light colored streak on the lunar surface
    originating from a crater. Rays range in length to over 150
    kilometers and usually several radiate from the same crater, like
    spokes of a wheel.
