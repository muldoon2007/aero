# Definition

Generic term for scintillation phenomena observed in light that reaches
the eye from sources lying within the earth's atmosphere; to be
differentiated from astronomical scintillation which is observed in
light from extraterrestrial sources such as stars. Also called
atmospheric boil, atmospheric shimmer, shimmer, optical haze.
Terrestrial scintillation is produced by irregular refraction effects
due to passage, across the line of sight, of air parcels (schlieren)
whose densities differ slightly from that of their surroundings. Density
irregularities with dimensions of the order of centimeters, or at most
decimeters, are responsible for most such scintillatory effects.
