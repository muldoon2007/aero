# Definition

One of the three commonly detectable points of zero polarization of
diffuse sky radiation, neutral points, along the vertical circle through
the sun; the other two are the Arago point and Babinet point. This
neutral point, discovered by Brewster in 1840, is located about 15� to
20� directly below the sun; hence it is difficult to observe because of
the glare of the sun.
