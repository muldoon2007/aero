# Definition

The state of stratification in a fluid in which surfaces of constant
pressure (isobaric) intersect surfaces of constant density (isosteric).
The number, per unit area, of isobaric-isosteric solenoids intersecting
a given surface is a measure of the baroclinity. Also called
baroclinicity, barocliny . Barotropy is the state of zero baroclinity.
Since the presence of solenoids (baroclinity) complicates the dynamics
of the fluid, there has been much investigation of the extent to which
an atmosphere, though obviously a baroclinic fluid, can be dynamically
treated as barotropic. See equivalent-barotropic model.
