# Definition

1.  A measure of the amount of refraction (a property of a dielectric
    substance). It is the ratio of the wavelength or phase velocity of
    an electromagnetic wave in a vacuum to that in the substance. Also
    called refractive index, absolute index of refraction, absolute
    refractive index, refractivity. See modified index of refraction,
    N-unit, potential index of refraction. It can be a function of
    wavelength, temperature, and pressure. If the substance is
    nonabsorbing and nonmagnetic at any wavelength, then n2 is equal to
    the dielectric constant at that wavelength. The complex index of
    refraction is obtained when the attenuation of the wave power
    radian, called the absorptive index k, is paired with the index of
    refraction. It is written n\* = n (1 - ik) When the wave passes from
    one medium n1 to another n2, the angle of incidence φ and the angle
    of refraction φ', both measured with respect to the normal to the
    interface, are related by sin φ / sin φ' = n1\* / n2\* = constant
    which becomes, for a nonabsorbing medium, the ratios of the
    (noncomplex) indices of refraction. In the particular case that
    medium 2 is a vacuum, this ratio is the index of refraction of
    medium 1. This is known as Snell law, named after Willebrord Snell
    who discovered it about 1621. 2. A measure of the amount of
    refraction experienced by a ray as it passes through a refractive
    interface, i.e., a surface separating two media of different
    densities. It is the ratio of the absolute indices of refraction of
    the two media (see sense 1 above). Also called refractive index,
    relative index of refraction.
