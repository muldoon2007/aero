# Definition

A dynamical problem whose solution determines the state of a system at
all times subsequent to a given time at which the state of the system is
specified by given initial conditions. Also called transient problem.
See boundary value problem. The initial-value problem is contrasted with
the steady-state problem, in which the state of the system remains
unchanged in time.
