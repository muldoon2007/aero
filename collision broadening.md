# Definition

In spectroscopy, the broadening or spreading of an emission line, due to
the interruption of the radiating process by a collision of the radiator
with another particle. In the case of cyclotron radiation, the collision
will actually change the phase of the radiation. For many collisions,
this has the effect of broadening the observed frequencies by an amount
equal to the collision rate.
