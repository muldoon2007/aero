# Definition

A pure number not involving any physical dimensions, e.g., a ratio of
two velocities or two lengths. Such numbers are fundamental descriptive
quantities of a physical system. Nondimensional numbers involving
several variables often are interpreted as estimates of characteristics
velocity ratios, force ratios, heat transfer ratios, frequency ratios,
etc. Usually several different ratio interpretations are possible and
useful for the same number. (See Mach number, Reynolds number,
Boussinesq number, Cauchy number, Prandtl number, Peclet number,
Rayleigh number, Strouhal number, Richardson number, Nusselt number,
Grashof number, Taylor number, Froude number.)
