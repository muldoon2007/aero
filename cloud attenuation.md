# Definition

Usually, the reduction in intensity of microwave radiation by clouds in
the earth's atmosphere. For the centimeter wavelength band, clouds
produce Rayleigh scattering. The attenuation is due largely to
scattering, rather than to absorption, for both ice and water clouds.
See precipitation attenuation. Compare cloud absorption.
