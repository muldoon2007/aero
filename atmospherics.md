# Definition

The radiofrequency electromagnetic radiation originating, principally,
in the irregular surges of charge in thunderstorm lightning discharges.
Atmospherics are heard as a quasi-steady background or crackling noise
(static) in ordinary amplitude-modulated radio receivers. Also called
atmospheric interference, strays, sferics . See sferics. Since any
acceleration of electric charge leads to emission of electromagnetic
radiation, and since the several processes involved in propagation of
lightning lead to very large charge accelerations, the lightning channel
acts like a huge transmitter, sending out broad band radiation; the
10-kilocycle range propagates best and is used in detecting
atmospherics. Atmospherics may occasionally be detected at distances in
excess of 2000 miles from their source. Advantage has been taken of this
in using radio direction-finding equipment to locate active thunderstorm
areas in remote regions and in between weather reporting stations.
