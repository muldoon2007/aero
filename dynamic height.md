# Definition

The height of a point in the atmosphere expressed in a unit proportional
to the geopotential at that point. Since the geopotential at altitude z
is numerically equal to the work done when a particle of unit mass is
lifted from sea level up to this height, the dimensions of dynamic
height are those of potential energy per unit mass. Also called
geodynamic height. The standard unit of dynamic height Hd is the dynamic
meter (or geodynamic meter), defined as 10 meters per second squared; it
is related to the geopotential , the geometric height z in meters, and
the geopotential height Z in geopotential meters by d= 10d Hd = 9.8dZ =
gdz where g is the acceleration of gravity in meters per second squared.
(Some sources prefer to give the constants 10 and 9.8 the units of
meters per second squared so that the units of and Z would be the same
as those of the geometric height.) The dynamic meter is about 2 percent
longer than the geometric meter and the geopotential meter. One of the
practical advantages of the dynamic height over the geometric height is
that when the former is introduced into the hydrostatic equation the
variable acceleration of gravity is eliminated. In meteorological height
calculations, geopotential height is more often used than dynamic
height.
