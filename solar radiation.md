# Definition

The total electromagnetic radiation emitted by the sun. See insolation,
direct solar radiation, diffuse sky radiation, global radiation,
extraterrestrial radiation, solar constant. To a first approximation,
the sun radiates as a black body at a temperature of about 5700 degrees
K; hence about 99.9 percent of its energy output falls within the
wavelength interval from 0.15 micron to 4.0 microns, with peak intensity
near 0.47 micron. About one-half of the total energy in the solar beam
is contained within the visible spectrum from 0.4 to 0.7 micron, and
most of the other half lies in the near infrared, a small additional
portion lying in the ultraviolet.
