# Definition

An absolute temperature scale independent of the thermometric properties
of the working substance. On this scale, the difference between two
temperatures T1 and T2 is proportional to the heat converted into
mechanical work by a Carnot engine operating between the isotherms and
adiabats through T1 and T2. Also called absolute temperature scale,
thermodynamic temperature scale. For convenience the Kelvin is
identified with the Celsius degree. The ice point in the Kelvin scale is
273.15 degrees K. The triple point of water, the fundamental reference
points, is 273.16 degrees K. See absolute zero, approximate absolute
temperature scale, Rankine temperature scale.
