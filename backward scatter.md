# Definition

The scattering of radiant energy into the hemisphere of space bounded by
a plane normal to the direction of the incident radiation and lying on
the same side as the incident ray; the opposite of forward scatter. Also
called back scattering . Atmospheric backward scatter depletes 6 to 9
percent of the incident solar beam before it reaches the earth's
surface. In radar usage, backward scatter refers only to that radiation
scattered at 180ï¿½ to the direction of the incident wave.
