# Definition

A hypothetical cone in the exosphere, directed vertically upward,
through which an atom or molecule would theoretically be able to pass to
outer space without a collision, that is, in which the mean free path is
infinite. See fringe region. Such a cone would open wider with
increasing altitude above the critical level of escape, and would be
nonexistent below the critical level of escape.
