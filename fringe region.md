# Definition

The upper portion of the exosphere, where the cone of escape equals or
exceeds 180ï¿½. In this region the individual atoms have so little chance
of collision that they essentially travel in free orbits, subject to the
earth's gravitation, at speeds imparted by the last collision. Also
called spray region. See escape velocity.
