# Definition

1.  A device having two stable states and two input terminals (or types
    of input signals) each of which corresponds with one of the two
    states. The circuit remains in either state until caused to change
    to the other state by application of the corresponding signal. 2. A
    similar bistable device with an input which allows it to act as a
    single-stage binary counter.
