# Definition

An instrument used for the measurement of direct solar radiation. See
pyrheliometer. It is constructed in the following manner. A silver disk
located at the lower end of a diaphragmed tube serves as the radiation
receiver for a calorimeter. Radiation falling on the silver disk is
periodically intercepted by means of a shutter located in the tube,
causing temperature fluctuations of the calorimeter which are
proportional to the intensity of the radiation. The instrument is
normally used as a secondary instrument and is calibrated against the
water-flow pyrheliometer. It is used by the U.S. Weather Bureau as a
standard instrument.
