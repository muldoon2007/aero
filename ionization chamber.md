# Definition

An apparatus used to study the production of small ions in the
atmosphere by cosmic ray and radioactive bombardment of air molecules.
The chamber is an airtight container usually cylindrical in shape and 25
to 50 liters in volume. An insulated electrode is centrally located in
the chamber. In operation a potential is applied between the electrode
and the chamber wall. The ions produced in the chamber are collected by
the electrode system and measured by an electrometer.
