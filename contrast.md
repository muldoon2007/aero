# Definition

1.  In general, the degree of differentiation between different tones in
    an image. Where the degree is slight, the image is said to be flat.
    Where the difference is marked, it is said to be contrasty. 2. The
    difference in luminance between two portions of the visual field
    usually expressed as: c = (background - test field)/background \*
    100% Since this ratio can be negative for nearly black targets at
    close range, and since the sign of the contrast has no
    psycho-physical significance, it is conventional to use only its
    absolute value. See threshold contrast.
