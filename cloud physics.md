# Definition

A subdivision of physical meteorology concerned with physical properties
of clouds in the atmosphere and the processes occurring therein. Cloud
physics, broadly considered, embraces not only the study of condensation
and precipitation processes in clouds, but also radiative transfer,
optical phenomena, electrical phenomena, and a wide variety of
hydrodynamic and thermodynamic processes peculiar to natural clouds.
