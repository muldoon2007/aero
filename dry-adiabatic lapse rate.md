# Definition

The rate of decrease of temperature with height of a parcel of dry air
lifted adiabatically through the earth's atmosphere in hydrostatic
equilibrium. This lapse rate is g/cp, where g is the acceleration of
gravity and cp is the specific heat of dry air at constant pressure;
numerically equal to 9.767� C per kilometer or about 5.4� F per thousand
feet. Potential temperature is constant with height in an atmosphere
with this lapse rate.
