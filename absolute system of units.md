# Definition

"1. A system of units in which a small number of units are chosen as
fundamental, and all other units are derived from them. 2. Specifically,
a system of electrical units put into effect by international agreement
on 1 January 1948. Prior to 1 January 1948 the international system was
in effect; the two systems can be converted by the following
relationships: 1 mean international ohm = 1.00049 absolute ohm 1 mean
international volt = 1.00034 absolute volt. ""Electric units, called
""international,"" for current and resistance had been introduced by the
International Electrical Congress held in Chicago in 1893, and the
definitions of the ""international"" ampere and the ""international""
ohm were confirmed by the International Conference of London in 1908.
Although it was already obvious on the occasion of the 8th CGPM (1933)
that there was a unanimous desire to replace those ""international""
units by so-called ""absolute"" units, the official decision to abolish
them was only taken by the 9th CGPM (1948), which adopted for the unit
of electric current, the ampere,"" which see. The previous is an excerpt
