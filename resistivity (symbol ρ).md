# Definition

In electricity, a characteristic proportionality factor equal to the
resistance of a centimeter cube of a substance to the passage of an
electric current perpendicular to two parallel faces. Also called
specific resistance. R = ρ( l/A ) where R is the resistance of a uniform
conductor, l is the length, A is its cross-sectional area, and ρ is its
resistivity.
