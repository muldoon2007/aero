# Definition

1.  Atmospheric noise, extraneous signals, etc., which tend to obscure
    the reception of a desired signal in a radio receiver, radarscope,
    etc. As compared with interference, clutter refers more particularly
    to unwanted reflections on a radar plan position indicator, such as
    ground return, but the terms are often used interchangeably. 2. =
    window.
