# Definition

1.  The sudden production of a large quantity of gas, usually hot, from
    a much smaller amount of a gas, liquid, or solid. 2. Specifically,
    an explosion, sense 1, produced by combustion of a fuel and an
    oxidizer. The distinction between an explosion, sense 2. and a
    detonation is that in an explosion the heat release rate and the
    number of molecules per unit volume increase with time more or less
    uniformly, whereas a detonation is propagated by an advancing shock
    front behind which exothermic reactions take place and thus is
    (spatially) nonuniform.
