# Definition

The empirical generalization that for many so-called perfect gases, the
product of pressure p and volume V is constant in an isothermal process:
pV = F(T) where the function F the temperature T cannot be specified
without reference to other laws (e.g., Charles-Gay-Lussac law). Also
called Boyle law, Mariotte law .
