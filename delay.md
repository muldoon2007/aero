# Definition

The time (or equivalent distance) displacement of some characteristic of
a wave relative to the same characteristic of a reference wave; that is,
the difference in phase between the two waves. Compare lag. In one-way
radio propagation, for instance, the phase delay of the reflected wave
over the direct wave is a measure of the extra distance traveled by the
reflected wave in reaching the same receiver.
