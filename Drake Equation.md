The Drake equation is a probabilistic argument used to estimate the
number of active, communicative extraterrestrial civilizations in the
Milky Way galaxy.

The Drake equation is all the stuff below multiplied together.

$$N*R*f_p*n_e*f_l*f_i*f_c*L$$

where:

N = the number of civilizations in our galaxy with which communication
might be possible (i.e. which are on our current past light cone); and

R = the average rate of star formation in our galaxy 

fp = the fraction of those stars that have planets 

ne = the average number of planets that can potentially support life per star that has planets 

fl = the fraction of planets that could support life that actually develop life at some
point 

fi = the fraction of planets with life that actually go on to develop intelligent life (civilizations) 

fc = the fraction of civilizations that develop a technology that releases detectable signs
of their existence into space 

L = the length of time for which such civilizations release detectable signals into space
