The Drake equation is a probabilistic argument used to estimate the
number of active, communicative extraterrestrial civilizations in the
Milky Way galaxy.

The Drake equation is all the stuff below multiplied together.

where:

N = the number of civilizations in our galaxy with which communication
might be possible (i.e. which are on our current past light cone); and

Râˆ— = the average rate of star formation in our galaxy fp = the fraction
of those stars that have planets ne = the average number of planets that
can potentially support life per star that has planets fl = the fraction
of planets that could support life that actually develop life at some
point fi = the fraction of planets with life that actually go on to
develop intelligent life (civilizations) fc = the fraction of
civilizations that develop a technology that releases detectable signs
of their existence into space L = the length of time for which such
civilizations release detectable signals into space\[5\]\[6\]
