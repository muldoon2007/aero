# Definition

The act, process, or instance of change of position. Also called
movement, especially when used in connection with problems involving the
motion of one craft relative to another. Absolute motion is motion
relative to a fixed frame of reference. Actual motion is motion of a
craft relative to the earth. Apparent or relative motion is change of
position as observed from a reference point which may itself be in
motion. Diurnal motion is the apparent daily motion of a celestial body.
Direct motion is the apparent motion of a planet eastward among the
stars; retrograde motion, the apparent motion westward among the stars.
Motion of a celestial body through space is called space motion, which
is composed of two components: proper motion, that component
perpendicular to the line of sight; and radial motion, that component in
the direction of the line of sight.
