1.  (Optics) definition submitted by Andy Young, June 30, 1997 An
    apparently reflected image of an object, caused by abnormal
    atmospheric refraction. The most commonly seen is the inferior
    mirage over heated surfaces, which often looks like a pool of water
    because it reflects the sky. Superior mirages, which appear above
    the direct image of the object, are due to strong thermal inversions
    above eye level. Other mirage-like images can be produced by thermal
    inversions below eye level, and by hot air adjacent to a wall heated
    by the Sun (lateral mirage). 2. (Radar) A refraction phenomenon in
    the atmosphere wherein an image of some object is made to appear
    displaced from its true position. See radio duct, note. Simple
    mirages may be any one of three types, the inferior mirage, the
    superior mirage, or the lateral mirage, depending, respectively, on
    whether the spurious image appears below, above, or to one side of
    the true position of the object. Of the three, the inferior mirage
    is the most common, being usually discernible over any heated street
    in daytime during summer. The abnormal refraction responsible for
    mirages is invariably associated with abnormal temperature
    distributions that yield abnormal spatial variations in the
    refractive index.
