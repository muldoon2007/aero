# Definition

1.  The phenomenon of amplification of a free wave or oscillation of a
    system by a forced wave or oscillation of exactly equal period. The
    forced wave may arise from an impressed force upon the system or
    from a boundary condition. The growth of the resonant amplitude is
    characteristically linear in time. 2. Of a system in forced
    oscillation, the condition which exists when any change, however
    small, in the frequency of excitation causes a decrease in the
    response of the system.
