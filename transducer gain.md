# Definition

The ratio of the power that a transducer delivers to a specified load
under specified operating conditions to the available power of a
specified source. If the input and/or output power consist of more than
one component, such as multifrequency signal or noise, then the
particular components used and their weighting must be specified. This
gain is usually expressed in decibels.
