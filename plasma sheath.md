# Definition

1.  The boundary layer of charged particles between a plasma and its
    surrounding walls, electrodes, or other plasmas. The sheath is
    generated by the interaction of the plasma with the boundary
    material. Current flow may be in only one direction across the
    sheath (single sheath), in both directions across the sheath (double
    sheath), or when the plasma is immersed in a magnetic field, it may
    flow along the sheath surface at right angles to the magnetic field
    (magnetic current sheath). 2. An envelope of ionized gas that
    surrounds a body moving through an atmosphere at hypersonic
    velocities. The plasma sheath affects transmission, reception, and
    diffraction of radio waves; thus it is important in operational
    problems of spacecraft.
