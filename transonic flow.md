# Definition

In aerodynamics, flow of a fluid over a body in the range just above and
just below the acoustic velocity. Transonic flow presents a special
problem in aerodynamics in that neither the equations describing
subsonic flow nor the equations describing supersonic flow can be
applied in the transonic range.
