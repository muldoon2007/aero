# Definition

Every particle of matter in the universe attracts every other particle
with a force, F, acting along the line joining the two particles,
proportional to the product of the masses M and m of the particles and
inversely proportional to the square of the distance r between the
particles, or F = G(M \* m) / r2, where G = gravitational constant.
