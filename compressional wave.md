# Definition

In acoustics, a wave in an elastic medium which causes an element of the
medium to change its volume without undergoing rotation. Mathematically,
a compressional wave is one whose velocity field has zero curl. Also
called compression wave. A compressional plane wave is a longitudinal
wave.
