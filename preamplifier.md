# Definition

1.  An amplifier, the primary function of which is to raise the output
    of a low-level source to an intermediate level so that the signal
    may be further processed without appreciable degradation in the
    signal-to-noise ratio of the system. A preamplifier may include
    provision for equalizing and/or mixing. 2. In radar an amplifier
    separated from the remainder of the receiver and located so as to
    provide the shortest possible input circuit path from the antenna so
    as to avoid deterioration of the signal-to-noise ratio.
