# Definition

1.  A shock wave theoretically occurring along a common line of
    intersection of all the pressure disturbances emanating from an
    infinitesimally small particle moving at supersonic speed through a
    fluid medium, with such a wave considered to exert no changes in the
    condition of the fluid passing through it. The concept of the Mach
    wave is used in defining and studying the realm of certain
    disturbances in a supersonic field of flow. 2. A very weak shock
    wave appearing, e.g., at the nose of a very sharp body, where the
    fluid undergoes no substantial change in direction.
