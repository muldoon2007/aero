# Definition

A condition within the earth's atmosphere that is virtually identical,
in terms of a particular function, with a condition in outer space. For
example, at 50,000 feet, the drop in air pressure and the scarcity of
oxygen creates a condition, so far as respiration is concerned, that is
equivalent to a condition in outer space where no appreciable oxygen is
present; thus, a physiological space equivalent is present in the
atmosphere.
