# Definition

1.  A two-dimensional barotropic disturbance in a fluid having one or
    more discontinuities in the vorticity profile. 2. A surface wave
    associated with the free boundary of a solid, such that a surface
    particle describes an ellipse whose major axis is normal to the
    surface and whose center is at the undisturbed surface. At maximum
    particle displacement away from the solid surface the motion of the
    particle is opposite to that of the wave. The propagation velocity
    of a Rayleigh wave is slightly less than that of a shear wave in the
    solid; the wave amplitude of the Rayleigh wave diminishes
    exponentially with depth.
