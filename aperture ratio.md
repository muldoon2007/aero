# Definition

The ratio of the useful diameter of a lens to its focal length. It is
the reciprocal of the f-number. In application to an optical instrument,
rather than to a lens, numerical aperture is more commonly used. The
aperture ratio is then twice the tangent of the angle whose sine is the
numerical aperture.
