# Definition

An approximately logarithmic measure of geomagnetic disturbance activity
based on the range of the most disturbed magnetic element during each
3-hour interval of the day. The K-indices are assigned integers from 0
to 9. The K-indices averaged over the observatories of the earth are
called planetary indices K p and divided into 28 grades.
