# Definition

The density a parcel of air would attain if compressed adiabatically by
descent to the standard pressure of 1000 millibars. The potential
density p' is most easily defined in relation to the potential
temperature θ as p' = p/Rθwhere p is a pressure of 10000 millibars and R
is the gas constant, in appropriate units. See adiabatic process.
