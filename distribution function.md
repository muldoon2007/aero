# Definition

The density function or number of particles per unit volume of phase
space. The distribution function is a function of the three space
coordinates and the three velocity coordinates. A point in phase space
represents a given position in ordinary space and a given velocity in
velocity space. Therefore, the distribution function evaluated at such a
point is the number or average density of particles per cubic length and
cubic velocity that have the position and the velocity which is
represented by the point. Distribution function represents the average
density over a reasonably long time, or the most probable distribution
of particles at a particular time.
