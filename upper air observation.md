# Definition

A measurement of atmospheric conditions aloft, above the effective range
of a surface weather observation. Also called sounding, upper air
sounding. See radiosonde. This is a general term, but is usually applied
to those observations which are used in the analysis of upper air charts
(as opposed to measurements of upper atmospheric quantities primarily
for research).
