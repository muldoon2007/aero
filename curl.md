# Definition

"A vector operation upon a vector field which represents the rotation of
the field, related to the circulation of the field at each point. The
curl is invariant with respect to coordinate transformations and is
usually written ""curl F"" of "" \* F"" where is the del-operator. In
Cartesian coordinates, if F has the components Fx, Fy, Fz the curl is
Expansions in other coordinate systems may be found in any text on
vector analysis. The curl of a two-dimensional vector field is always in
a field of solid rotation it is equal to twice the angular velocity.
Occasionally the vorticity is defined as one-half the curl. The curl of
a two dimensional vector field is always normal to the vectors of the
field; this is not necessarily true in three dimensions. Compare
divergence."
