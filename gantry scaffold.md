# Definition

A massive scaffolding structure mounted on a bridge or platform
supported by a pair of towers or trestles that normally run back and
forth on parallel tracks, used to assemble and service a large rocket as
the rocket rests on its launching pad. Often shortened to gantry. This
structure is a latticed arrangement of girders, tubing, platforms,
cranes, elevators, instruments, wiring, floodlights, cables, and
ladders - all used to attend the rocket.
