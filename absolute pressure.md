# Definition

In engineering literature, a term used to indicate pressure above the
absolute zero value of pressure that theoretically obtains in empty
space or at the absolute zero of temperature as distinguished from gage
pressure. In high-vacuum technology, pressure is understood to
correspond to absolute pressure, not gage pressure, and therefore the
term absolute pressure is rarely used.
