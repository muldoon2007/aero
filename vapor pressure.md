# Definition

1.  The pressure exerted by the molecules of a given vapor. For a pure
    confined vapor, it is that vapor's pressure on the walls of its
    containing vessel; and for a vapor mixed with other vapors or gases,
    it is that vapor's contribution to the total pressure (i.e., its
    partial pressure). Also called vapor tension. In meteorology, vapor
    pressure is used almost exclusively to denote the partial pressure
    of water vapor in the atmosphere. See saturation vapor pressure,
    equilibrium vapor pressure. 2. The sum of the partial pressures of
    all the vapors in a system.
