# Definition

The angle between any given ray of scattered radiation and the incident
ray. See relative scatter intensity, scattering. Convention varies as to
whether this angle is measured with respect to the direction in which
the incident radiation was advancing or with respect to the direction
from scatterer to radiation source.
