# Definition

1.  In supersonic diffuser aerodynamics, a nonsteady shock motion and
    airflow associated with the shock system ahead of the inlet, very
    rapid pressure pulsations are produced which can affect downstream
    operation in the burner, nozzle, etc. 2. Sustained oscillation of an
    aerodynamic control surface caused by intermittent flow separation
    on the surface, or by a motion of shock waves across the surface, or
    by a combination of flow separation and shock-wave motion on the
    surface.
