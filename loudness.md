# Definition

The intensive attribute of an auditory sensation, in terms of which
sounds may be ordered on a scale extending from soft to loud. Loudness
is measured in sones. Loudness depends primary upon the sound pressure
of the stimulus, but it also depends upon the frequency and waveform of
the stimulus.
