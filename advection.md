# Definition

The process of transport of an atmospheric property solely by the mass
motion of the atmosphere; also, the rate of change of the value of the
advected property at a given point. Regarding the general distinction
(in meteorology) between advection and convection, the former describes
the predominantly horizontal, large-scale motions of the atmosphere
whereas convection describes the predominantly vertical, locally induced
motions.
