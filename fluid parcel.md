# Definition

In any fluid, an imaginary portion of that fluid which for theoretical
studies may be considered to have all the basic dynamic and
thermodynamic properties of the fluid but which is small enough so that
its motion with respect to the surrounding fluid does not induce marked
compensatory movements. Also called parcel. The size of the fluid parcel
cannot be given precise numerical definition but it must be large enough
to contain a great number of molecules and small enough so that the
properties assigned to it are approximately uniform within it.
