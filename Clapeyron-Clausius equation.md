# Definition

The differential equation relating pressure to temperature in a system
in which two phases of a substance are in equilibrium. dp/dT = L/(T V)
where p is pressure; T is temperature; L is the latent heat of the phase
change; and V is the difference in volume of the phases. Also called
Clapeyron equation, Clausius-Clapeyron equation.
