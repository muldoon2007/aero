# Definition

In meteorology, an expression relating the curvature of the trajectory
Ki of a fluid parcel to the streamline Ks where v is the parcel speed,
is the local change of wind direction, is the wind angle, and t is time.
The curvatures and change of wind direction are positive for cyclonic
flow.
