# Definition

An instrument for taking photographs (spectroheliograms) of the image of
the sun monochromatic light. The wavelength of light chosen for this
purpose corresponds to one of the Fraunhofer lines, usually the light of
hydrogen or ionized calcium. A similar instrument used for visual,
instead of photographic, observations in a spectrohelioscope.
