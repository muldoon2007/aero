# Definition

An ionization gage in which the ions are produced by collisions with
electrons emitted from a hot filament (or cathode) and accelerated by an
electric field. Also called hot-filament ionization gage, ionization
gage , or simply ion gage. The Bayard-Alpert ionization gage employs a
tube with an electrode structure designed to minimize X-ray induced
electron emission from the ion collector.
