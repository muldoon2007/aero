# Definition

Pressure exerted upon any material body by electromagnetic radiation
incident upon it. See Poynting-Robertson effect. This pressure is
manifested whenever the electromagnetic momentum is a radiation field is
changes, and is exactly twice as great when the radiation is reflected
at normal incidence as it is when the radiation is entirely absorbed at
normal incidence. The magnitude of any radiation-pressure effect is
directly proportional to the intensity of the radiation, and is very
small by most standards. On a perfectly reflecting surface Pr = u/3
where u is radiation density, the amount of radiative energy per unit
volume in the space above the surface. Radiation pressure has a
perceptible effect on the orbit of earth satellites, especially those
with a large reflecting surface such as Echo.
