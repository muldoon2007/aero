# Definition

Rime aircraft icing is opaque, brittle, and granular. It is formed by
the rapid freezing of small supercooled water droplets, allowing air to
be trapped in. It is generally less hazardous than glaze icing, because
it usually forms more slowly and is more conformal to the existing
aerodynamic surface. It is the most frequent type, composing about 75%
of icing reports.
