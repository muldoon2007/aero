# Definition

1.  A measure of the rate of attenuation per unit length; the rate of
    flux-density (or power) reduction as energy (visual,
    electromagnetic, acoustic) propagates from its source. Also called
    attenuation factor, decay constant . Compare attenuation
    coefficient. For free-space transmission of radar frequency energy,
    the attenuation constant is usually expressed in decibels per mile
    or kilometer (db/mi or db/km). 2. Specifically, of a traveling plane
    wave at a given frequency, the relative rate of decrease of
    amplitude of a field component (or of voltage or current) in
    direction of propagation in nepers per unit length.
