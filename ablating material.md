# Definition

A material, especially a coating material, designed to provide thermal
protection to a body in a fluid stream through loss of mass. Ablating
materials are used on the surfaces of some reentry vehicles to absorb
heat by removal of mass, thus blocking the transfer of heat to the rest
of the vehicle and maintaining temperatures within design limits.
Ablating materials absorb heat by increasing in temperature and changing
in chemical or physical state. The heat is carried away from the surface
by a loss of mass (liquid or vapor). The departing mass also blocks part
of the convective heat transfer to the remaining material in the same
manner as transpiration cooling.
