# Definition

The average number of ionizing collisions an electron will make in
drifting a unit distance in the direction of the applied electric force.
These coefficients were first measured by Townsend and at present they
are well tabulated for most gases. A typical value for the coefficient
is one pair per centimeter at a pressure of 1 millimeter of mercury and
a field strength of 100 volts per centimeter.
