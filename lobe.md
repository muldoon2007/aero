# Definition

An element of a beam of focused radio energy. Lobes define surfaces of
equal power density at varying distances and directions from the
radiating antenna. Their configuration is governed by two factors: (a)
the geometrical properties of the antenna reflector and feed system; and
(b) the mutual interference between the direct and reflected rays for an
antenna situated above a reflecting surface. In addition to the major
lobes of an antenna system, there exist side lobes (or minor lobes) that
result from the unvoidable finite size of the reflector. They exist at
appreciable angles from the axis of the beam, and, while objectionable,
they normally contain much less energy than that in the major lobe. See
radiation pattern.
