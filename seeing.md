# Definition

A blanket term long used by astronomers for the disturbing effects
produced by the atmosphere upon the image quality of an observed
celestial body. Also called astronomical seeing. Recent studies show
that seeing is a combination of three principal and distinct effects
that the human eye is not capable of distinguishing: (a) scintillation,
i.e., fluctuations in brightness; (b) transverse displacements of the
image; and (c) variations of the radius of curvature of the wavefront
rendering the image in an out of focus.
