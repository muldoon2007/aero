# Definition

A liquid-level vacuum gage in which a known volume of gas, at the
pressure to be measured, is compressed by the movement of a liquid
column to a much smaller known volume, at which the resulting higher
pressure is measured. Particular designs are named after the inventors
or by various trade names.
