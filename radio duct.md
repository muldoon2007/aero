# Definition

A rather shallow, almost horizontal layer in the atmosphere through
which vertical temperature and moisture gradients are such as to produce
an index of refraction lapse rate of greater than -48 N-units per 1000
feet. Strong temperature, or moisture inversions, or both are necessary
for the formation of radio ducts. The resulting superstandard
propagation is such as to cause the curvature of rays traveling through
it to be greater than that of the earth. Radio energy which originates
within the duct and leaves the antenna at angles near the horizontal may
thus be trapped within the layer. See anomalous propagation, skip
effect. The effect is similar to that of a mirage (it is sometimes
called radio mirage), and radar targets may be detected at phenomenally
long ranges if both target and radar are in the duct. The greater the
elevation angle between radar and target, the less the possibility of
serious distortion due to transmission through ducts. Ducts may be
surface based or elevated, with thickness ranging from a few tens of
feet up to a maximum of 1000 feet. Elevated ducts are generally
associated with subsidence or frontal inversions and are seldom found
above 15,000 to 20,000 feet.
