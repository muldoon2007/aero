# Definition

1.  The flow or motion of a fluid in or through a given area or
    volume. 2. A precise measure of the average flow of fluid along a
    given closed curve. Mathematically, circulation is the line
    integral. about the closed curve, where v is the fluid velocity, and
    dr is a vector element of the curve. By Stokes theorem, the
    circulation about a plane curve is equal to the total vorticity of
    the fluid enclosed by the curve. The given curve may be fixed in
    space or may be defined by moving fluid parcels.
