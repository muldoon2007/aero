# Definition

1.  In a gas, the net rate of transfer of momentum in the direction of
    the positive normal to an imaginary plane surface of specified area
    located in a specified position in the gas by molecules crossing the
    surface in both directions, momentum transmitted in the opposite
    direction being counted as negative, divided by the area of the
    surface. In general, it is assumed that the area of the imaginary
    plane surface is small enough so that the pressure with respect to
    any part of the surface is equal (within narrow limits) to the
    pressure based on the whole surface. Different kinds of pressure
    (static, dynamic, partial, total, vapor, etc.) are distinguished by
    the orientation of the surface with respect to mass-flow velocity
    vectors or by the restriction to a specified set of molecular
    species crossing the imaginary surface. 2. On a boundary surface,
    the force applied per unit area and equal to the pressure in the gas
    as determined by molecules crossing an imaginary surface located at
    a fixed distance of molecular magnitude in front of the real
    surface, the positive normal being drawn from the imaginary surface
    toward the real surface. The term pressure when used alone can be
    assumed to refer to the total pressure in a gas at rest or else to
    refer to the static pressure in a gas flowing under steady-state
    conditions. 3. = atmospheric pressure. 4. As measured in a vacuum
    system, the quantity measured at a specified time by a so-called
    vacuum gage, whose sensing element is located in a cavity (gage
    tube) with an opening oriented in a specified direction at a
    specified point within the system, assuming a specified calibration
    factor. The sensitivity of the sensing element is, in general, not
    the same for all molecular species, but the gage reading is
    frequently reported using the calibration factor for air regardless
    of the composition of the gas. The opening to the gage tube is often
    carelessly oriented with respect to mass-flow vectors in the gas
    (which is seldom at rest), and errors due to variations in wall
    temperatures of tube and system are frequently neglected. The actual
    total pressure in a high-vacuum system cannot usually be measured by
    a single gage, but in vacuum technology the term total pressure is
    sometimes used to refer to the reading of a single untrapped gage
    which responds to condensable vapors as well as permanent gases.
