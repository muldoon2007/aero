# Definition

1.  An arbitrarily defined temperature within the temperature range in
    which metal fracture characteristics determined usually by notched
    tests are changing rapidly such as from primarily fibrous (shear) to
    primarily crystalline (cleavage) fracture. 2. The arbitrarily
    defined temperature in a range in which the ductility of a material
    changes rapidly with temperature.
