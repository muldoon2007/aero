# Definition

1.  A measure of the amount of normally incident radiant energy absorbed
    through a unit distance or by a unit mass of absorbing medium.
    Compare transmission coefficient. The absorption coefficient is
    frequently identified as follows: where ILx is the flux density of
    radiation of wavelength L, initially of flux density IL0, after
    traversing a distance x in some absorbing medium. (Substitute L for
    lambda.) 2. In acoustics, the ratio of the sound energy absorbed by
    a surface of a medium (or material) exposed to a sound field or
    sound radiation to the sound energy incident on the surface. The
    stated values of this ratio are to hold for an infinite area of the
    surface. The conditions under which measurements of absorption
    coefficients are made are to be stated explicitly. Three types of
    absorption coefficients associated with three methods of measurement
    are: chamber absorption coefficient, obtained in a certain
    reverberation chamber; free-wave absorption coefficient, obtained
    when a plane, progressive, sound wave is incident on the surface of
    the medium; sabine absorption coefficient, obtained when the sound
    is incident from all directions on the sample.
