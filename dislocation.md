# Definition

In crystallography, a type of lattice imperfection whose existence in
metals is postulated in order to account for the phenomenon of crystal
growth and of slip, particularly for the low value of shear stress
required to initiate slip. One section of the crystal adjacent to the
slip plane is assumed to contain one more atomic plane that the section
on the opposite side of the slip plane. Motion of the dislocation
results in displacement of one of the sections with respect to another.
