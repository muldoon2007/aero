# Definition

A special case of process lapse rate, defined as the rate of decrease of
temperature with height of an air parcel lifted in a
saturation-adiabatic process through an atmosphere in hydrostatic
equilibrium. Also called moist-adiabatic lapse rate. Owing to the
release of latent heat, this lapse rate is less than the dry-adiabatic
lapse rate, and the differential equation representing the process must
be integrated numerically. Wet-bulb potential temperature is constant
with height in an atmosphere with this lapse rate.
