# Definition

A computing machine working on the principle of measuring, as
distinguished from counting, in which the input data is analogous to a
measurement continuum, such as linear lengths, voltages, resistances,
etc., which can be manipulated by the computer. Analog computers range
in complexity from a slide rule to electrical computers used for solving
mathematical problems.0
