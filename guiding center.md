# Definition

The center point of the Larmor orbit of a charged particle gyrating in a
magnetic field. It is often convenient to separate the total motion of a
particle into the Larmor orbit plus the motion of the guiding center. In
addition to the unimpeded motion of the guiding center of a particle
along the magnetic field, the presence of electric fields will displace
the guiding center perpendicular to the magnetic field.
