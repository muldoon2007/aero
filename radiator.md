# Definition

1.  Any source of radiant energy, especially electromagnetic
    radiation. 2. A device that dissipates the heat from something, as
    from water or oil, not necessarily by radiation only. Generally, the
    application of the terms radiator (in sense 2) or heat exchanger to
    a particular apparatus depends upon the point of view: If the
    emphasis is upon merely getting rid of heat, radiator is most often
    used, or sometimes cooler; if the emphasis is upon transferring
    heat, heat exchanger is used â€“ but these distinctions do not always
    hold true.
