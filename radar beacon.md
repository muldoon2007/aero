# Definition

A beacon transmitting a characteristic signal on radar frequency,
permitting a craft to determine the bearing and sometimes the range of
the beacon. A racon returns a coded signal when triggered by the proper
type of radar pulse; a ramark continuously transmits a signal which
appears as a radial line on the plan position indicator.
