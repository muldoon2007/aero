# Definition

A thermal conductivity vacuum gage in which an increase of pressure from
the zero point causes a decrease in the temperature of a heated filament
of material having a large temperature coefficient of resistance, thus
unbalancing a Wheatstone bridge circuit (or the circuit is adjusted to
maintain the filament temperature constant).
