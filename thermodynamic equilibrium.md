# Definition

A very general result from statistical mechanics which states that if a
system is in equilibrium, all processes which can exchange energy must
be exactly balanced by the reverse process so that there is no net
exchange of energy. For instance, ionization must be balanced by
recombination, bremsstrahlung by absorption, etc. If a plasma complies
with this statement, the distribution function of particle energies and
excited energy levels of the atoms can be obtained from the
Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution which is a function only of the
temperature.
