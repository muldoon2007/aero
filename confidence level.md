# Definition

In statistics, the degree of desired trust or assurance in a given
result. A confidence level is always associated with some assertion and
measures the probability that a given assertion is true. For example, it
could be the probability that a particular characteristic will fall
within specified limits, i.e., the chance that the true value of P lies
between P = a and P = b. See confidence interval.
