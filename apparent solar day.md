# Definition

The duration of one rotation of the earth on its axis, with respect to
the apparent sun. It is measured by successive transits of the apparent
sun over the lower branch of a meridian. The length of the apparent
solar day is 24 hours of apparent time and averages the length of the
mean solar day, but varies somewhat from day to day.
