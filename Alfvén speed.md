The speed at which Alfvén waves are propagated along the magnetic field.
For a perfectly conducting fluid with a mass density of 1 kilogram per
cubic meter in a magnetic field of 10,000 gauss, the Alfvén speed is
about 1,000 meters per second while the speed of sound in air is about
300 meters per second.
