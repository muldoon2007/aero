# Definition

1.  In general, a deviation from the norm. 2. In geodesy, a deviation of
    an observed value from a theoretical value, due to an abnormality in
    the observed quantity. 3. In celestial mechanics, the angle between
    the radius vector to an orbiting body from its primary (the focus of
    the orbital ellipse) and the line of apsides of the orbit, measured
    in the direction of travel, from the point of closest approach to
    the primary (perifocus). The term defined above is usually called
    true anomaly v to distinguished it from the eccentric anomaly E
    which is measured at the center of the orbital ellipse to the
    projection of the body onto the auxiliary circle of the ellipse, or
    from the mean anomaly M which is what the true anomaly would become
    if the orbiting body had a uniform annular motion. The mean anomaly
    M can be computed by M = n (t - T) where n is mean motion; t is time
    of the computation; and T is time of perifocus. The eccentric
    anomaly E and the mean anomaly M are related by the Kepler equation
    M = E - e sin E where e is eccentricity of the ellipse. From E, the
    true anomaly v can be obtained by tan v/2=\[(1+e)/(1-e)\]1/2 tan
    E/2.
