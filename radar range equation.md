# Definition

The relation between the maximum range Rmax at which a point target is
detectable and the properties of the radar and the target Rmax =
\[(PA2λ2σ)/(4π)3Smin)\]1/4 where P is the transmitted power of the
radar; λ is its wavelength; σ is the scattering cross section of the
target; A is the antenna gain; and Smin is the threshold signal.
