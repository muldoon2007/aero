# Definition

1.  A hypothetical atmosphere in which the density is constant with
    height. The lapse rate of temperature in such an atmosphere is known
    as the autoconvective lapse rate and is equal to g/R (or
    approximately 3.4 degrees C per 100 meters) where g is the
    acceleration of gravity and R is the gas constant for air. A
    homogeneous atmosphere has a finite total thickness which is given
    by RdTv/g, where Rd is the gas constant for dry air and Tv is the
    virtual temperature (degrees K) at the surface. For a surface
    temperature of 273 degrees K, the vertical extent of the homogeneous
    atmosphere on the earth is approximately 8000 meters. At the top of
    such an atmosphere both the pressure and absolute temperature
    vanish. 2. With respect to radio propagation, an atmosphere which
    has a constant index of refraction, or one in which radio waves
    travel in straight lines at constant speed. Free space is the ideal
    homogeneous atmosphere in this sense. 3. Same as adiabatic
    atmosphere. See barotrophy.
