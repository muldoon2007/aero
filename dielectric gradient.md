# Definition

The spatial variation of the dielectric constant in a substance or
medium. This term is used frequently in reference to the propagation of
radio energy. The magnitude of these gradients and the distance over
which they occur, relative to the wavelength of the incident radiation,
determine the extent to which targets will reflect radar energy.
Sufficiently intense dielectric gradients (or index of refraction
gradients) are believed to be the cause of certain echoes known as
angels.
