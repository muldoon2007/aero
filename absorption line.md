# Definition

A minute range of wavelength (or frequency) in the electromagnetic
spectrum within which radiant energy is absorbed by the medium through
which it is passing. Each line is associated with a particular mode of
electronic excitation induced in the absorbing atoms by the incident
radiation. See absorption spectrum, spectral line, telluric lines,
Fraunhofer lines, absorption band.
