# Definition

A great circle of the celestial sphere, through the celestial poles and
the zenith. The expression usually refers to the upper branch, that half
of the great circle from pole to pole which passes through the zenith;
the other half being the lower branch. The celestial meridian coincides
with the hour circle through the zenith and the vertical circle through
the elevated pole.
