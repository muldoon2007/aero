# Definition

The separation of electric charges accompanying the aerodynamic breakup
of water drops, first studied systematically by the German physicist P.
Lenard. Also called spray electrification, waterfall effect. Compare
Macky effect. Experiments have shown that the degree of charge
separation in spray processes depends upon the drop temperature,
presence of dissolved impurities, speed of the impinging airblast, and
contact with foreign surfaces. The largest fragments of the broken drops
are observed to carry positive charges and the fine spray of drops
carried off in the impinging air current carries a net negative charge.
