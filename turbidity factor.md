# Definition

A measure of the atmospheric transmission of incident solar radiation.
If I0 is the flux density of the solar beam just outside the earth's
atmosphere, I the flux density measured at the earth's surface with the
sun at a zenith distance which implies an optical air mass m , and Im,w
the intensity which would be observed at the earth's surface for a pure
atmosphere containing one centimeter of perceptible water viewed through
the given optical air mass, then Linke's turbidity factor θ is given by
θ = (ln I0 - ln I)/(ln I0 - ln Im,w)
