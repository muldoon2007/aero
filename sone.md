# Definition

A unit of loudness. A simple tone of frequency 1000 cycles per second,
40 decibels above a listener's threshold, produces a loudness of 1 sone.
The loudness of any sound that is judged by the listener to be n times
that of the 1-sone tone is n sones. A millisone is equal to 0.001 sone.
The loudness scale is a relation between loudness and level above
threshold for a particular listener. In presenting data relating
loudness in sones to sound pressure level, or in averaging the loudness
scales of several listeners, the thresholds (measured or assumed) should
be specified.
