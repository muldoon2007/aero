# Definition

The emission of an electron from a surface as the surface absorbs a
photon of electromagnetic radiation. Electrons so emitted are termed
photoelectrons. The effectiveness of the process depends upon the
surface metal concerned and the wavelength of the radiant energy to
which it is expressed. Cesium, for example, will emit electrons when
exposed to visible radiation. The energy of the electron produced is
equal to the energy of the incident photon minus the amount of work
needed to raise the electron to a sufficient energy level to free it
from the surface. The resulting energy of the electron, therefore, is
proportional to the frequency (i.e., inversely proportional to the
wavelength) of the incident radiation.
