# Definition

The height of a given point in the atmosphere in units proportional to
the potential energy of unit mass ( geopotential) at this height,
relative to sea level. The relation, in the cgs system, between the
geopotential height H and the geometric height Z is where g is the
acceleration of gravity, so that the two heights are numerically
interchangeable for most meteorological purposes. Also, 1 geopotential
meter is equal to 0.98 dynamic meter. See dynamic height. At the present
time, the geopotential height unit is used for all aerological reports,
by convention of the World Meteorological Organization.
