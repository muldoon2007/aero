# Definition

Change in the direction of the axis of rotation of a spinning body, as a
gyro, when acted upon by a torque. See apparent wander, precession of
the equinoxes. The direction of motion of the axis is such that it
causes the direction of spin of the gyro to tend to coincide with that
of the impressed torque. The horizontal component of precession is
called drift, and the vertical component is called topple.
