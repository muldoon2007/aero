# Definition

The outermost, or topmost, portion of the atmosphere. Its lower boundary
is the critical level of escape, variously estimated at 500 to 1000
kilometers above the earth's surface. Also called region of escape. See
atmospheric shell. In the exosphere, the air density is so low that the
mean free path of individual particles depends upon their direction with
respect to the local vertical, being greatest for upward moving
particles (see cone of escape, fringe region). It is only from the
exosphere that atmospheric gases can, to any appreciable extent, escape
into outer space.
