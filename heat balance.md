# Definition

1.  The equilibrium which exists on the average between the radiation
    received by a planet and its atmosphere from the sun and that
    emitted by the planet and atmosphere. That the equilibrium does
    exist in the mean is demonstrated by the observed long-term
    constancy of the earth's surface temperature. On the average,
    regions of the earth nearer the equator than about 35 degrees
    latitude receive more energy from the sun than they are able to
    radiate, whereas latitudes higher than 35 degrees received less. The
    excess of heat is carried from low latitudes to higher latitudes by
    atmospheric and oceanic circulations and is reradiated there. 2. The
    equilibrium which is known to exist when all sources of heat gain
    and loss for a given region or body are accounted for. In general
    this balance includes advective, evaporative (etc.) terms as well as
    a radiation term.
