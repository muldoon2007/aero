# Definition

An elongated dark band in the cloud surface of Jupiter at about the
latitude of the Great Red Spot. It was first seen in 1901 as a dark spot
which then spread rapidly. It has at times exceeded 180 degrees of
longitude in length and, like the Red Spot, appears and disappears
intermittently.
