# Definition

To mix two radio signals of different frequencies to produce a third
signal which is of lower frequency, i.e., to produce beating. Radar
receivers are of the heterodyne type (as contrasted to the
superregenerative type) because the very high radio frequencies used in
radar are difficult to amplify. A target signal is heterodyned with a
current of lower frequency produced by a klystron oscillator and the
resulting intermediate-frequency signal can then be highly amplified for
subsequent presentation or analysis.
