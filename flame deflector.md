# Definition

1.  In a vertical launch, any of variously designed obstructions that
    intercept the hot gases of the rocket engine so as to deflect them
    away from the ground or from a structure. The flame deflector may be
    a relatively small device fixed to the top surface of the pad
    surrounded by the framework of the launcher, or it may be a heavily
    constructed piece of metal mounted as a side and bottom of a flame
    bucket. In the latter case, the deflector may be perforated with
    numerous holes connected with a source of water, bending at an angle
    of about 45ï¿½ into the line of the exhaust stream. During thrust
    buildup and the beginning of the launch, a deluge of water pours
    from the holes in such a deflector to keep it from melting. See
    deluge collection pond. 2. In a captive test, an elbow in the
    exhaust conduit or flame bucket that deflects the flame into the
    open.
