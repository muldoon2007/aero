One of the three commonly detectable points along the vertical circle
through the sun at which the degree of polarization of diffuse sky
radiation goes to zero; a neutral point. The Arago point, so named for
its discoverer, is customarily located at about 20Â° above the antisolar
point; but it lies at higher altitudes in turbid air. The latter
property makes the Arago distance a useful measure of atmospheric
turbidity.
