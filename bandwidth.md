# Definition

1.  In an antenna, the range of frequencies within which its
    performance, in respect to some characteristic, conforms to a
    specified standard. 2. In a wave, the least frequency interval
    outside of which the power spectrum of a time-varying quantity is
    everywhere less than some specified fraction of its value at a
    reference frequency. 3. The number of cycles per second between the
    limits of a frequency band. Sense 2 permits the spectrum to be less
    than the specified fraction within the interval. Unless otherwise
    stated, the reference frequency is that at which the spectrum has
    its maximum value. 4. In information theory, the
    information-carrying capacity of a communications channel.
