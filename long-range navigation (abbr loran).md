# Definition

A two-dimensional pulse-synchronized radio navigation system to
determine hyperbolic lines of position through pulse-time differencing
from a master compared to two slave stations. Loran uses the frequency
band 1.7 to 2.0 megacycles; loran C (Cytac) uses transmission at 100
kilocycles and phase compares the continuous wave in the pulse envelopes
for greater accuracy using pulse technique for resolving ambiguities.
