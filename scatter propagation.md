# Definition

Specifically, the long-range propagation of radio signals by scattering
due to index of refraction inhomogeneities in the lower atmosphere. Also
called tropospheric propagation. Recognition of this process and the
development of specialized equipment (basically, more powerful
transmitters and sensitive receivers) has greatly increased the range of
VHF and UHF communication. The over-all technique is known as scatter
communication.
