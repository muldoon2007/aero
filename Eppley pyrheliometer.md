# Definition

A pyrheliometer of the thermoelectric type. Radiation is allowed to fall
on two concentric silver rings, the outer covered with magnesium oxide
and the inner covered with lampblack. A system of thermocouples
(thermopile) is used to measure the temperature difference between the
rings. Attachments are provided so that measurements of direct and
diffuse solar radiation may be obtained. This instrument has been
adopted by the U.S. Weather Bureau for station use. For instrumentation
