# Definition

The reduction in the magnitude of some characteristics of a signal
between two stated points in a transmission system. Also called loss.
The characteristic is often some kind of level, such as power level or
voltage level; in acoustics, the characteristic that is commonly
measured is sound pressure level. Thus, if the levels are expressed in
decibels, the transmission level loss is likewise in decibels. It is
imperative that the characteristic concerned (such as the sound pressure
level) by clearly identified because in all transmission systems more
than one characteristic is propagated.
