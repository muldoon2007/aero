# Definition

The energy which a body possesses as a consequence of its motion,
defined as one-half the product of its mass m and the square of its
speed v, 1/2 mv2. The kinetic energy per unit volume of a fluid parcel
is the 1/2 p v2 , where p is the density and v the speed of the parcel.
See potential energy. For relativistic speeds the kinetic energy is
given by Ek = mc2 - m0c2 where c is the velocity of light in a vacuum,
m0 is the rest mass, and m is the moving mass.
