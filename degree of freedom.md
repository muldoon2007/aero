# Definition

1.  A mode of motion, either angular or linear, with respect to a
    coordinate system, independent of any other mode. A body in motion
    has six possible degrees of freedom, three linear and three
    angular. 2. Specifically, of a gyro the number of orthogonal axes
    about which the spin axis is free to rotate. 3. In an unconstrained
    dynamic or other system, the number of independent variables
    required to specify completely the state of the system at a given
    moment. If the system has constraints, i.e., kinematic or geometric
    relations between the variables, each such relation reduces by one
    the number of degrees of freedom of the system. In a continuous
    medium with given boundary conditions, the number of degrees of
    freedom is the number of normal modes of oscillation. 4. Of a
    mechanical system, the minimum number of independent generalized
    coordinates required to define completely the positions of all parts
    of the system at any instant of time. In general, the number of
    degrees of freedom equals the number of independent generalized
    displacements that are possible.
