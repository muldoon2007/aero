# Definition

1.  The quantity obtained by multiplying the distance between two
    magnetic poles by the average strength of the poles. 2. A measure of
    the magnetic flux set up by the gyration of an electric charge in a
    magnetic field. The moment is negative, indicating it is
    diamagnetic, and equal to the energy of rotation divided by the
    magnetic field. 3. (symbol m). In atomic and nuclear physics, a
    moment, measured in Bohr magnetons, associated with the intrinsic
    spin of the particle and with the orbital motion of the particle in
    a system. Also called magnetic dipole moment.
