# Definition

1.  A two-degree-of-freedom gyro whose spin axis may be oriented in any
    specified attitude. In a free gyro, output signals are produced by
    gimbal angular displacements which correspond to components of the
    angular displacement of the base. 2. A gyro not provided with an
    erection system, i.e., a gyro free to move about its axes.
