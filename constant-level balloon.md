# Definition

A balloon designed to float at a constant-pressure level. Also called
constant-pressure balloon. See skyhook balloon. In one design for such a
system, a pressure switch actuates a valve which controls the release of
ballast so as to maintain flight above a selected pressure level until
the supply of ballast is exhausted. Another design is a simple
nonextensible envelope capable of withstanding a differential of
pressure, higher inside than out. It is inflated so that the smaller
night-time pressure of the gas still fully extends the envelope. Such a
superpressure balloon will keep essentially constant level until enough
gas diffuses out of it to allow diurnal changes in volumes.
