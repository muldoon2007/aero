# Definition

1.  The ratio of the power that a transducer delivers to a specified
    load, under specified operating conditions, to the power absorbed by
    its input circuit. If the input and/or output power consist of more
    than one component, such as multifrequency signal or noise, then the
    particular components used and their weighting must be specified.
    This gain is usually expressed in decibels. 2. Of an antenna, in a
    given direction, 4pi times the ratio of the radiation intensity in
    that direction to the total power delivered to the antenna.
