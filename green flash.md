# Definition

A brilliant green coloring of the upper edge of the sun as it appears at
sunrise or disappears at sunset when there is a clear, distinct horizon.
The green flash is due to refraction by the atmosphere, which disperses
the first (or last) spot of light into a spectrum. The green is bent
more than red or yellow and hence is visible sooner at sunrise and later
at sunset.
