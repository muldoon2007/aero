# Definition

A measure of the dispersion (scatter) of data points with respect to a
curve of regression. S is the positive square root of the arithmetic
mean of the squares of the deviations from a curve of regression: where
d is deviation from R ; R is curve of regression; and n is number of
points. S is a measure of the variation to be expected in making
predictions from the regression equation.
