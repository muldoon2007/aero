# Definition

An electron which has been ejected from its parent atom by interaction
between that atom and a high-energy photon. Photoelectrons are produced
when electromagnetic radiation of sufficiently short wavelength is
incident upon metallic or other solid surfaces (photoelectric effect) or
when radiation passes through a gas.
