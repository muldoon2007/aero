# Definition

A general species of radar transmitting continuous waves, either
modulated or unmodulated. The simplest form transmits a single frequency
and detects only moving targets by the Doppler effect. This type of
radar determines direction but usually not range. Also called CW radar.
Compare pulse radar. Two advantages of CW radar are the narrow bandwidth
and low power required. Range information may be obtained by some form
of modulation, e.g., frequency modulation, pulse modulation.
