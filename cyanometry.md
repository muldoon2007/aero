# Definition

The study and measurement of the blueness of the sky. The characteristic
blue color of clear skies is due to preferential scattering of the short
wavelength components of visible sunlight by air molecules. Presence of
foreign particles in the atmosphere alters the scattering processes in
such a way as to reduce the blueness. Hence spectral analysis of diffuse
sky radiation provides useful information concerning the scattering
particles.
