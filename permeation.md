# Definition

As applied to gas flow through solids, the passage of gas into, through,
and out of a solid barrier having no holes large enough to permit more
than a small fraction of the gas to pass through any one hole. The
process always involves diffusion through the solid and may involve
various surface phenomena, such as sorption, dissociation, migration,
and desorption of the gas molecules.
