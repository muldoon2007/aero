# Definition

The acceleration on a particle moving in a curved path, directed toward
the instantaneous center of curvature of the path, with magnitude v2/R,
where v is the speed of the particle and R the radius of curvature of
the path. This acceleration is equal and opposite to the centrifugal
force per unit mass.
