# Definition

The relative decrease of the volume of a gaseous system with increasing
pressure in an isothermal process. This coefficient is -(1/V)(V/ p)T
where V is the volume; p is the pressure; and T is the temperature. The
reciprocal of this quantity is the bulk modulus. Also called
compressibility. Compare coefficient of thermal expansion, coefficient
of tension.
