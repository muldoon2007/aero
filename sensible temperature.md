# Definition

The temperature at which average indoor air of moderate humidity would
induce, in a lightly clothed person, the same sensation of comfort as
that induced by the actual environment. Compare effective temperature.
Sensible temperature depends on the air temperature; radiation from the
sun, sky, and surrounding objects; relative humidity; and air motion.
The wet-bulb temperature is often taken as an approximate measure.
