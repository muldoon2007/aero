# Definition

The angle between the plane of the reference meridian and the plane
through the polar axis and the normal to the spheroid. It is the
astronomical longitude corrected for the prime vertical component of the
deflection of the vertical divided by the cosine of the latitude. Also
called geographic longitude. This is the longitude used for charts.
