# Definition

1.  The shell of hydrogen surrounding the earth at the limit of the
    atmosphere. In Shlovsky's system of nomenclature, the geocorona
    includes the metasphere, the outer, fully ionized zone, and the
    protosphere, the inner zone. 2. = Van Allen radiation belts. The use
    of geocorona in sense 2 should be discouraged, since it conflicts
    with the relatively well-established usage in sense 1.
