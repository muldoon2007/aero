# Definition

The decrease in temperature which takes place when a gas expands through
a throttling device as a nozzle. Also called Joule-Kelvin effect. The
rate of change of temperature T with pressure p in the Joule-Thomson
effect is called the Joule-Thomson coefficient (symbol Î¼): where h
denotes constant enthalpy. For the Joule-Thomson effect to take place
the gas must initially be below its inversion temperature; if above the
inversion temperature, the gas will gain heat on expansion. The
inversion temperature of hydrogen, for example, is approximately -183
degrees C.
