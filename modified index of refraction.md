# Definition

An atmospheric index of refraction mathematically modified so that when
its gradient is applied to energy propagation over a hypothetical flat
earth it is substantially equivalent to propagation over the true curved
earth with the actual index of refraction. Also called refractive
modulus, modified refractive index. Compare potential index of
refraction. The modified index of refraction is usually expressed in
M-units; mathematically where n is the index of refraction at a point in
the atmospheric; h is the height above mean sea level of that point; a
is the radius of the earth; and N is the index of refraction in N-units.
In ray tracing problems, the vertical gradient dM/dh can be used
directly to obtain a ray path curvature that is relative to the
curvature of the earth, i.e., where k is a value by which the earth's
radius is multiplied to get the radius of curvature of the ray path; ka
is called the effective earth radius.
