# Definition

1.  The partial differential equation 2 = F where 2 is the Laplacian
    operator; a scalar function of position; and F is a given function
    of the independent space variables. For the special case F = 0, the
    Poisson equation reduces to the Laplace equation. See relaxation
    method. 2. The relationship between the temperature T and pressure p
    of a perfect gas undergoing an adiabatic process; given by T =
    constant X pμ where μ is the Poisson constant. This equation defines
    a family of process lines, called isentropes or dry adiabats, each
    of which represents the changes of state possible in a fluid with a
    constant value of entropy.
