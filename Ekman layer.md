# Definition

The layer of transition between the surface boundary layer, where
shearing stress is constant, and the free atmosphere, where the
atmosphere is treated as an ideal fluid in approximate geostrophic
equilibrium. Also called spiral layer. In Ekman's analysis (see Ekman
spiral), the coefficient of eddy viscosity is assumed constant within
this layer; subsequent calculations have relaxed this assumption.
