# Definition

The propagation of radio energy over a smooth spherical earth of uniform
dielectric constant and conductivity under conditions of standard
refraction in the atmosphere, i.e., an atmosphere in which the index of
refraction decreases uniformly with height at a rate of 12 N-units per
1000 feet. See superstandard propagation, substandard propagation,
standard atmosphere. Standard propagation results in a ray curvature due
to refection which has a value approximately one-fourth that of the
earth's curvature, giving a radio horizon which is about 15 percent
greater than the distance to the geometrical horizon. This is equivalent
to straight-line propagation over a fictitious earth whose radius is
four-thirds the radius of the actual earth.
