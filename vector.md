# Definition

Any quantity, such as force, velocity, or acceleration, which has both
magnitude and direction at each point in space, as opposed to a scalar
which has magnitude only. Such a quantity may be represented
geometrically by an arrow of length proportional to its magnitude,
pointing in the assigned direction. A unit vector is a vector of unit
length; in particular, the three unit vectors along the positive X-, Y-,
Z-axes of rectangular Cartesian coordinates are denoted, respectively,
by i, j, and k. Any vector A can be represented in terms of its
components, a1, a2, and a3 along the coordinate axes X, Y, and Z,
respectively; e.g., A = a1 + a2 + a3. A vector drawn from a fixed origin
to a given point (X, Y, Z) is called a position vector and is usually
symbolized by r; in rectangular Cartesian coordinates, r = xi + yj + zk
Equations written in vector form are valid in any coordinate system.
Mathematically, a vector is a single-row or -column array of functions
obeying certain laws of transformation. See scalar product, vector
product, tensor, Helmholtz theorem.
