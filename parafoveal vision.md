# Definition

Vision in which the eye is so oriented toward the pertinent light source
as to have the light fall upon some portion of the retina surrounding
the fovea. Also called scotopic vision. See foveal vision. The portion
of the retina used in this type of vision contains receptors known as
rods. Although these rods do not permit the sort of color-sensing vision
possible with the cones in the central or foveal region of the retina,
they have the useful property of responding to very low illuminance,
particularly after dark adaptation is complete. Nighttime vision is
performed primarily with the rods.
