# Definition

A positively charged particle emitted from the nuclei of certain atoms
during radioactive disintegration. The alpha particle has an atomic
weight of 4 and a positive charge equal in magnitude to 2 electronic
charges; hence it is essentially a helium nucleus (helium atom stripped
of its two planetary electrons). Compare beta particle, gamma ray.
