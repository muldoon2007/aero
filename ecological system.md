# Definition

A habitable environment, either created artificially, as in a manned
space vehicle, or occurring naturally, such as the environment on the
surface of the earth, in which man, animals, or other organisms can live
in mutual relationship with one another and the environment. Ideally the
environment furnishes the sustenance for life, and the resulting waste
products revert or cycle back into the environment to be used again for
the continuous support of life.
