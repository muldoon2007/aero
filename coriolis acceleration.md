# Definition

An acceleration of a particle moving in a relative coordinate system.
The total acceleration of the particle, as measured in an inertial
coordinate system, may be expressed as the sum of the acceleration
within the relative system, the acceleration of the relative system
itself, and the coriolis acceleration. Physically, coriolis acceleration
may be considered as coming from the conservation of momentum in a body
moving in a direction not parallel to the axis of rotation of the
relative system. Mathematically, coriolis acceleration comes from the
differentiation of terms containing the angular velocity in the
expression for the absolute velocity of the particle. In the case of the
earth, moving with angular velocity , a particle moving relative to the
earth with velocity v has the coriolis acceleration 2 \* v. If Newton
laws are to be applied in the relative system, the coriolis acceleration
and the acceleration of the relative system must be treated as forces.
See apparent force, coriolis force, inertial force, gravity.
