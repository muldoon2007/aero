# Definition

An idealized reversible thermodynamic cycle. The Carnot cycle consists
of four stages: (a) an isothermal expansion of the gas at temperature
T1; (b) an adiabatic expansion to temperature T2; (c) an isothermal
compression at temperature T2; (d) an adiabatic compression to the
original state of the gas to complete the cycle. See Carnot engine,
thermodynamic efficiency. In a Carnot cycle, the net work done is the
difference between the heat inputQ1at higher temperatureT1and the heat
extractedQ2at the lower temperatureT2.
