# Definition

A weakening of the effectiveness of the directional properties of a loop
antenna by the capacitance of the loop to the ground. Also called height
effect . In usual direction-finding practice on ground waves, antenna
effect would be manifested: (a) if in phase, by an angular displacement
of the nulls from 180° displacement and (b), if in quandrature, by a
residual signal obscuring the nulls. The in-phase effect is often used
to eliminate the 180° ambiguity (i.e., to permit sense finding).
