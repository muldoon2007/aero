The number of molecules in 1 mole of gas ( 6.02252 * 10^23 per mole).
That this number is a constant for permanent gases is the Avogadro law:
under normal conditions, i.e., pressure of 1 standard atmosphere and
temperature of 0Â° C, the volume occupied by 1 mole of gas is the same
for all permanent gases (22,414 cubic centimeters). See [[Loschmidt number]]
