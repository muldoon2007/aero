# Definition

An atmosphere in hydrostatic equilibrium in which the temperature is
constant with height and in which, therefore, the pressure decreases
exponentially upward. In such an atmosphere the thickness between any
two levels is given by ZB - ZA = (RdTv /g) ln (pA/pB) where Rd is the
gas constant for dry air; Tv is the virtual temperature (K); g is the
acceleration of gravity, and pA and pB are the pressures at the heights
ZA and ZB respectively. In the isothermal atmosphere there is no finite
level at which the pressure vanishes. Also called exponential
atmosphere. See barotropy.
