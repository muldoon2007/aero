# Definition

An infinite series of increasing power of the variable, of the form anxn
= a0 + a1x + a2x2 . . . + anxn Both the variable and the coefficients
may take on complex values. The totality of values of x for which a
power series is convergent is called the interval of convergence of the
series.
