# Definition

The average luminance (or brightness) of those objects and surfaces in
the immediate vicinity of an observer. Also called adaptation
brightness, adaptation level, adaptation illuminance. The adaptation
luminance has a marked influence on an observer's estimate of the visual
range because, along with the visual angle of the object under
observation, it determines the observer's threshold contrast. High
adaptation luminance tends to produce a high threshold contrast, thus
reducing the estimated visual range. This effect of the adaptation
luminance is to be distinguished from the influence of background
luminance.
