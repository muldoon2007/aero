# Definition

The broadening of either an emission line or an absorption line due to
random motions of molecules of the gas that is emitting or absorbing the
radiant energy. See pressure broadening. In the case of an emitting gas,
for example, those molecules which are approaching the observer as they
emit quanta of radiant energy will, because of the Doppler effect,
appear to send out a train of waves of slightly shorter wavelength than
that characteristic of a stationary molecule, while receding molecules
will appear to emit slightly longer wavelengths. The net effect,
averaged over many molecules, is to superimpose, on the natural line
width, a bell-shaped broadening that is proportional to the square root
of the absolute temperature of the gas.
