# Definition

A force is a given coordinate system arising from the inertia of a
parcel moving with respect to another coordinate system. The inertial
force is proportional and directionally opposite to the accelerating
force. Also called inertia force. For example, the coriolis acceleration
on a parcel moving with respect to a coordinate system fixed in space
becomes an inertial force, the coriolis force, in a coordinate system
rotating with the earth.
