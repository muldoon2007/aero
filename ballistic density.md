# Definition

A representation of the atmospheric density actually encountered by a
projectile in flight, expressed as a percentage of the density according
to the standard artillery atmosphere. Thus, if the actual density
distribution produced the same effect upon a projectile as the standard
density distribution, the ballistic density would be 100 percent .
