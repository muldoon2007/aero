# Definition

A mirage effect produced by greater-than-normal refraction in the lower
atmosphere, thus permitting objects to be seen that are usually below
the horizon. This occurs when the air density decreases more rapidly
with height than in the normal atmosphere. If the rate of decrease of
density with height is greater in the region followed by the ray from
the top of the object than for the ray from the bottom of the object,
the image will be stretched vertically. This stretching is often called
looming but is more properly termed towering. The antonym of looming is
sinking and that of towering is stooping.
