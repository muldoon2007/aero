# Definition

A condition of the body resulting from the existence of a pressure
differential between the total ambient pressure and the total pressure
of dissolved and free gases within the body tissues, fluids, and
cavities. Characteristic symptoms, other than hypoxia, caused by
decreased barometric pressure are bends and abdominal gas pains at
altitudes above 25,000 to 30,000 feet. Increased barometric pressure, as
in descent from high altitude is characterized by painful distention of
the ear drums.
