# Definition

A division of the ionosphere, usually found at an altitude between 100
and 120 kilometers in the E-region. It exhibits one or more distinct
maximums and sharp gradients of free electron density. It is most
pronounced in the daytime but does not entirely disappear at night. Also
called E1 - layer, Kennelly-Heaviside layer, Heaviside layer. See
sporadic E-layer (under ionosphere), atmospheric shell, ionosphere.
There is some evidence to indicate a second layer above the normal
E-layer located at about 150 kilometers, and called the E2-layer.
