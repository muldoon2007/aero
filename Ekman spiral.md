# Definition

As used in meteorology, an idealized mathematical description of the
wind distribution in the planetary boundary layer of the atmosphere,
within which the earth's surface has an appreciable effect on the air
motion. The model is simplified by assuming that within this layer eddy
viscosity and density are constant, the motion is horizontal and steady,
the isobars are straight and parallel, and the geostrophic wind is
constant with height.
