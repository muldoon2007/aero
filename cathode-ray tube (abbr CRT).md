# Definition

A vacuum tube consisting essentially of an electron gun producing a
concentrated electron beam (or cathode ray) which impinges on a
phosphorescent coating on the back of a viewing face (or screen). The
excitation of the phosphor produces light, the intensity of which is
controlled by regulating the flow of electrons. Deflection of the beam
is achieved either electromagnetically by currents in coils around the
tube, or electrostatically by voltages on internal deflection plates.
