# Definition

Irregular and fluctuating gradients of optical refractive index in the
atmosphere. Optical turbulence is caused mainly by mixing of air of
different temperatures, and particularly by thermal gradients which are
sufficient to reverse the normal decrease in density with altitude, so
that convection occurs.
