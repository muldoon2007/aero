# Definition

A meteor which has been detected by the reflection of a radio signal
from the meteor trail of relatively high ion density ( ion column). See
whistling meteor. Compare photographic meteor. Such an ion column is
left behind a meteoroid when it reaches the region of the upper
atmosphere between about 80 and 120 kilometers, although occasionally
radio meteors are detect at higher altitudes. The maximum reflection
occurs when the column is perpendicular to the line to the
transmitter-receiver.
