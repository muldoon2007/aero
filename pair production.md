# Definition

An absorption process for X-ray and gamma ray radiation in which the
incident photon is annihilated in the vicinity of the nucleus of the
absorbing atom, with subsequent production of an electron and positron
pair. This reaction does not occur for incident radiation energies of
less than 1.02 million electron volts.
