# Definition

The rate of decrease of the temperature T of an air parcel as it is
lifted, -dT/dz , when z is altitude, or, occasionally, dT/dp , where p
is pressure. The concept may be applied to other atmospheric variables,
e.g., the process lapse rate of density. The process lapse rate is
determined by the character of the fluid processes and should be
carefully distinguished from the environmental lapse rate, which is
determined by the distribution of temperature in space. In the
atmosphere the process lapse rate is usually assumed to be either the
dry-adiabatic lapse rate or the saturation-adiabatic lapse rate.
