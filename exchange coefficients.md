# Definition

Coefficients of eddy flux (e.g., of momentum, heat, water vapor, etc.)
in turbulent flow, defined in analogy to those of the kinetic theory of
gases (see eddy). Also called austausch coefficients, eddy coefficients,
interchange coefficients. The exchange-coefficient hypothesis states
that the mean eddy flux per unit area of a conservative quantity
(suitability expressed) is proportional to the gradient of the mean
value of this quantity, that is, Mean flux per unit area = -Ce (d/ dN)
where Ce is the exchange coefficient; E is the mean value of the
quantity; and N is the direction normal to the surface. In strict
analogy to molecular properties; Ce would be constant, for turbulent
flow Ce turns out to depend on time and location. See eddy viscosity
diffusivity.
