# Definition

A material that has a high cross section for slowing down fast neutrons
with a minimum of absorption, e.g., heavy water, beryllium, used in
reactor cores. Moderators are used to improve the neutron utilization by
slowing the neutrons to low energies, thereby increasing the probability
of fission capture in the nuclear fuel.
