# Definition

A device used to calibrate linear accelerometers with rated ranges of,
or below, +/- 1.0 g. It allows the accelerometer to be positioned at
different angles in reference to a surface perpendicular to the
direction of the earth's gravity, so that the applied values of
acceleration are equal to the cosine of the angle between the reference
surface and the direction of the earth's gravity.
