# Definition

A theoretical rocket postulated for parameters that are corrected in
practice. An ideal rocket assumes a homogeneous and invariant
propellant, observance of the perfect gas laws, no friction, no heat
transfer across the rocket wall, an axially directed velocity of all
exhaust gases, a uniform gas velocity across every section normal to the
nozzle axis, and chemical equilibrium established in the combustion
chamber and maintained in the nozzle.
