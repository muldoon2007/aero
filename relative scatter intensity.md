# Definition

For scattering of radiation under any given set of physical conditions:
the ratio of the radiant intensity scattered in any given direction to
the radiant intensity scattered in the direction of the incident beam.
The value of this ratio is a function of the angle between the direction
in question and the directions of the incident beam. Thus, it may be
symbolized as f(œÅ), the relative scattering function. Compare scattering
function. See scatter angle.
