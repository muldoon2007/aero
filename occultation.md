# Definition

The disappearance of a body behind another body of larger apparent size.
When the moon passes between the observer and a star, the star is said
to be occulted. The three associated terms, occultation, eclipse, and
transit, are exemplified by the motions of the satellites of Jupiter. An
eclipse occurs when a satellite passes into the shadow cast by the
planet; an occultation occurs when a satellite passes directly behind
the planet; so that it could not be seen even if it were illuminated;
and a transit occurs when a satellite passes between the observer and
the planet, showing against the disk of the planet.
