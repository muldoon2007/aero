# Definition

An aircraft engine incorporating a fan or propeller enclosed in a duct;
especially, a jet engine in which an enclosed fan or propellant is used
to ingest ambient air to augment the gases of combustion in the
jetstream. The air may be taken in at the front of the engine and passed
around the combustion section, or it may be taken in aft of the
combustion chamber. In the former case the ducted fan may be considered
a type of bypass engine.
