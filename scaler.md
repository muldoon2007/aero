# Definition

A device that produces an output pulse whenever a prescribed number of
input pulses have been received. Also called scaling circuit. The number
of input pulses per output pulse of a scaler is termed the scaling
factor. A binary scaler is a scaler whose scaling factor is 2. A decade
scaler is a scaler whose scaling factor is 10.
