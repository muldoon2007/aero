# Definition

An intrinsic physical property of a substance, describing its ability to
conduct heat as a consequence of molecular motion. The thermal
conductivity bears the same relation to the conduction of heat as the
dynamic viscosity does to the transfer of momentum. It can be defined by
reference to the Newton law of cooling: H = -k ( T / N ) where k is the
thermal conductivity; H the rate of heat conduction across a surface per
unit area and per unit time; and T / N the temperature gradient normal
to the surface. Also called heat conductivity, coefficient of thermal
conduction, coefficient of heat conduction.
