# Definition

Any surface which reflects incident rays in a mutliplicity of
directions, either because of irregularities in the surface or because
the material is optically inhomogeneous, as a paint, although optically
smooth; the opposite of a specular reflector. See perfectly diffuse
reflector. Ordinary writing papers are good examples of diffuse
reflectors, where as mirrors or highly polished metal plates are
examples of specular reflectors. Almost all terrestrial surfaces (except
calm water) act as diffuse reflectors of incident solar radiation.
