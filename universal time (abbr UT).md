# Definition

Time defined by the rotational motion of the earth and determined from
the apparent diurnal motions which reflect this rotation; because of
variations in the rate of rotation, universal time is not rigorously
uniform. Also called Greenwich mean time. Compare ephemeris time. In the
years preceding 1960 the arguments of the ephemerides in the American
Ephemeris and Nautical Almanac were designated as universal time.
