# Definition

1.  The process by which electromagnetic energy is propagated through
    free space by virtue of joint undulatory variations in the electric
    and magnetic fields in space. This concept is to be distinguished
    from conduction and convection. A group of physical principles known
    as the radiation laws comprise, to a large extent, the current state
    of practical knowledge of the complex radiative processes. 2. The
    process by which energy is propagated through any medium by virtue
    of the wave motion of that medium, as in the propagation of sound
    wave through the atmosphere, or ocean waves along the water
    surface. 3. = radiant energy. 4. = electromagnetic radiation,
    specifically, high-energy radiation such as gamma rays and
    X-rays. 5. Corpuscular emissions, such as α or β-radiation. 6. =
    nuclear radiation. 7. = radioactivity.
