# Definition

The study dealing with the phenomena of the atmosphere. This includes
not only the physics, chemistry, and dynamics of the atmosphere, but is
extended to include many of the direct effects of the atmosphere upon
the earth's surface, the oceans, and life in general. A distinction can
be drawn between meteorology and climatology, the latter being primarily
concerned with average, not actual, weather conditions. Meteorology may
be subdivided, according to the methods of approach and the applications
to human activities, into a large number of specialized sciences. The
following are of interest to space science: aerology, aeronomy, dynamic
meteorology, physical meteorology, radio meteorology.
