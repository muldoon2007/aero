# Definition

An inertial force on a moving body, or particles, produced by the
movement of the masses involved, perpendicular to the axis of the
primary rotating system. Also called compound centrifugal force,
deflecting force. See inertial force, coriolis acceleration. Such a
force is required if Newton Laws are to be applied in the system.
