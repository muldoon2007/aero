# Definition

A grouping of cosmic-ray particles observed in the atmosphere; a cascade
shower in the atmosphere. Also called shower . Primary cosmic rays
slowed down in the atmosphere emit bremsstrahlung photons of high
energy. Each of these photons produces secondary electrons which
generate more photons and the process continues until the available
energy is absorbed.
