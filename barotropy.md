# Definition

The state of a fluid in which surfaces of constant density (or
temperature) are coincident with surfaces of constant pressure; it is
the state of zero baroclinity. Mathematically, the equation of barotropy
states that the gradients of the density and pressure fields are
proportional: where is the density; p is the pressure; and B is a
function of thermodynamic variables, called the coefficient of
barotropy. With the equation of state, this relation determines the
spatial distribution of all state parameters once these are specified on
any surface. For a homogeneous atmosphere, B=0; for an adiabatic
atmosphere, B = c v / cp RT where cv and cp are the specific heats at
constant volume and pressure, respectively; R is the gas constant; and T
is the Kelvin temperature; for an isothermal atmosphere, B = 1/RT.
