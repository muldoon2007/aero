# Definition

The condition which exists in a rotating body when the axis about which
it is forced to rotate, or to which reference is made, is parallel with
a principal axis of inertia. No products of inertia about the center of
gravity of the body exist in relation to the selected rotational axis.
Dynamic unbalance may be expressed in terms of slug-foot squared (or
equivalent weight \* length squared units) or in terms of inclination of
the principal axis from the reference axis.
