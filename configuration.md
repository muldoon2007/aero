# Definition

1.  Relative position or disposition of various things, or the figure or
    pattern so formed. 2. A geometric figure, usually consisting
    principally of points and connecting lines. 3. = planetary
    configuration. 4. A particular type of a specific aircraft, rocket,
    etc., which differs from others of the same model by virtue of the
    arrangement of its components or by the addition or omission of
    auxiliary equipment as long-range configuration, cargo
    configuration. Some writers use constellation as a synonym for
    configuration in referring to the relative positions of spacecraft
    to each other, as in a rendezvous maneuver, or to celestial bodies.
    This usage should be discouraged.
