# Definition

A curve plotted for the ascent of a rocket vehicle calculated to give
the vehicle an optimum economy in fuel with an optimum velocity. This
curve, plotted to minimize air resistance, starts off vertically, but
bends towards the horizontal between 20 and 60 miles altitude to
minimize the thrust required for vertical ascent.
