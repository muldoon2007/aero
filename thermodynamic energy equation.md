# Definition

The mathematical statement of the concept of conservation of energy
embodied in the first law of thermodynamics. For reversible processes of
a perfect gas, it may be written in the form pQ = ρcv (dT/dt) - (p/ρ)
(dρ) (dt) where pQ is the rate of energy addition per unit volume by
heating (including the effects of radiation, molecular conduction,
condensation water vapor, and the generation of heat by friction); T is
the Kelvin temperature; cv is the specific heat at constant volume; p is
pressure; and ρ is density. See energy equation.
