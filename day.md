# Definition

1.  The duration of one rotation of the earth, or another celestial
    body, on its axis. A day is measured by successive transits of a
    reference point on the celestial sphere over the meridian, and each
    type takes its name from the reference used. Thus, for a solar day
    the reference is the sun; a mean solar day if the mean sun; and an
    apparent solar day if the apparent sun. For a lunar day the
    reference is the moon; for sidereal day the vernal equinox; for a
    constituent day an astre fictif or fictitious star. The expression
    lunar day refers also to the duration of one rotation of the moon
    with respect to the sun. A Julian day is the consecutive number of
    each day, beginning with January 1, 4713 BC. 2. A period of 24 hours
    beginning at a specified time, as the civil day beginning at
    midnight, or the astronomical day beginning at noon.
