# Definition

1.  Of any conic, the ratio of the length of the radius vector through a
    point on the conic to the distance of the point from the
    directrix. 2. Of an ellipse, the ratio of the distance between the
    center and focus of an ellipse to its semimajor axis. Also called
    numerical eccentricity. The eccentricity e of an ellipse can be
    computed by the formula where a is the semimajor axis and b is the
    semiminor axis. 3. Of an ellipse, the distance between the center
    and the focus. Also called linear eccentricity.
