An instrument for measuring height above a reference datum;
specifically, an instrument similar to an aneroid barometer that
utilizes the change of atmospheric pressure with altitude to indicate
the approximate elevation above a given point or plane used as a
reference. See absolute altimeter, pressure altimeter, radio altimeter.
