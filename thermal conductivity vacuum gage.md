# Definition

A vacuum gage containing two surfaces at different temperatures between
which heat can be transported by the gas molecules so that changes in
the temperature (or in the heating power required to maintain constant
temperature) of one of the surfaces can be correlated with the gas
pressure by calibration against a McLeod gage. Various types of thermal
conductivity gages are distinguished according to the method of
indicating the temperature change. The common type are: Pirani gage;
thermocouple gage; thermistor gage; bimetallic strip gage.
