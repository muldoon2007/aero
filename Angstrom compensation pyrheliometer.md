An instrument developed by K. Ångström for the measurement of direct
solar radiation. The radiation receiver station consists of two
identical manganin strips whose temperatures are measured by attached
thermocouples. One of the strips is shaded, whereas the other is exposed
to sunlight. An electrical heating current is passed through the shaded
strip so as to raise its temperature to that of the exposed strip. The
electric power required to accomplish this is a measure of the solar
radiation. See actinometer, pyrheliometer. Compare Ångström pyrgeometer.
