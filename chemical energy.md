# Definition

Energy produced or absorbed in the process of a chemical reaction. In
such a reaction, energy losses or gains usually involve only the
outermost electrons of the atoms or ions of the system undergoing
change; here a chemical bond of some type is established or broken
without disrupting the original atomic or ionic identities of the
constituents. Chemical changes, according to the nature of the materials
entering into the change, may be induced by heat (thermochemical), light
(photochemical), and electric (electrochemical) energies.
