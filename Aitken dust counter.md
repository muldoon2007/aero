An instrument developed by John Aitken for determining the dust content
of the atmosphere. In operation, a sample of air is mixed, in an
expandable chamber, with a larger volume of dust-free air containing
water vapor. Upon a sudden expansion, the chamber cools adiabatically
below its dewpoint, and the droplets form with the dust particles as
nuclei (Aitken nuclei). A portion of these droplets settle on a ruled
plate in the instrument and are counted with the aid of a microscope.
Also called Aitken nucleus counter .
