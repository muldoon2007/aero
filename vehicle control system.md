# Definition

A system, incorporating control surfaces or other devices, which adjusts
and maintains the altitude and heading, and sometimes speed, of a
vehicle in accordance with signals received from a guidance system. The
essential difference between a control system and a guidance system is
that the control system points the vehicle and the guidance system gives
the commands which tell the control system where to point. However, the
control system maintains theinstantaneous orientation of the vehicle
without specific commands from the guidance system.
