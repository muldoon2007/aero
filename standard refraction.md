# Definition

The refraction which would occur in an idealized atmosphere in which the
index of refraction decreases uniformly with height at the rate of 39 X
10E-6 per kilometer. See standard propagation. Standard refraction may
be included in ground-wave calculations by use of an effective earth
radius of 8.5 X 10E6 meters, or four-thirds the geometrical radius of
the earth.
