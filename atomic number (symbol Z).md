# Definition

An integer that expresses the positive charge of the nucleus in
multiples of the electronic charge e. It is the number of electrons
outside the nucleus of a neutral (un-ionized) atom and, according to
widely accepted theory, the number of protons in the nucleus. See atomic
weight, Table IV. An element of atomic number Z occupies the Zth place
in the periodic table of the elements. Its atom has a nucleus with a
charge +Ze, which is normally surrounded by Z electrons, each of charge
-e. For example, the carbon isotope 6C14 has an atomic number of 6 and
an atomic mass of 14.
