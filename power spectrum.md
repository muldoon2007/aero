# Definition

The square of the amplitude of the (complex) Fourier coefficient of a
given periodic function. Thus if f(t) is periodic with period T , its
Fourier coefficients are where ω = 2π/T and the power spectrum of f(t)
is \|F(n)\|2. Here n take integral values and the spectrum is discrete.
The total energy of the periodic function is infinite, but the power, or
energy per unit period, is finite.
