# Definition

1.  In computer operations, the time required for a pulse to fall to
    one-tenth of its peak value. See rise time. 2. In charge-storage
    tubes, the time interval during which the magnitude of the stored
    charge decreases to a stated fraction of its initial value. The
    fraction is usually 1/e where e is the base of natural
    logarithms. 3. Approximately the lifetime of an orbiting object in a
    nonstable orbit. Decay time is usually applied only to objects with
    short orbit lifetimes caused by atmospheric drag.
