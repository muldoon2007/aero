# Definition

In statistics, a measure of variability (or spread); the mean-square
deviation from the mean, that is , the mean of the squares of the
differences between individual values of x and the mean value μ. σ =
E\[(x - μ)2\] = E(x2) - μ2 where E denotes expected value. The positive
square root σ of the variance is called the standard deviation.
