# Definition

An atmospheric parameter defined by TM = (M0 / M)T where M0 is the mean
molecular weight at sea level, M is the mean molecular weight at
altitude, and T is air temperature at altitude. Up to an altitude of
about 90 kilometers, the molecular composition of air is constant; thus
M0 / M = 1 and T M = T. Above 90 kilometers, M0 / M is greater than
unity, and T M is greater than T.
