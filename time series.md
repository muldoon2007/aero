# Definition

The values of a variable generated successively in time. A continuous
barograph trace is an example of a continuous time series , whereas a
sequence of hourly pressures is an example of a discrete time series.
Graphically, a time series is usually plotted with time as the abscissa
and the values of the function as the ordinate.
