# Definition

A gage in which pressure is measured by the rate of decay in amplitude
of the oscillations of an element suspended in the gas and set into
motion by external controls. Also known as decrement viscosity gage or
viscosity manometer. Various types of decrement gage are distinguished
according to the design of the oscillating element.
