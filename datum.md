# Definition

Any numerical or geometrical quantity or set of such quantities which
can serve as a reference or a base for measurement of other quantities.
For a group of statistical references, the plural form is data; as
geographic data for a list of latitudes and longitudes. Where the
concept is geometrical the plural form is datums; as in two geodetic
datums have been used.
