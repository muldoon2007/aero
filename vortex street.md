# Definition

Two parallel rows of alternately placed vortexes along the wake of an
obstacle in a fluid of moderate Reynolds number. Also called Karman
vortex street, vortex trail vortex train. Fluid drag can be calculated
from the motion of these vortexes, which are stable only for a certain
radio of the width of the street to the distance between vortexes along
the street.
