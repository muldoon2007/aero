# Definition

An atmospheric ion, apparently a singly charged atmospheric molecule
(or, rarely, an atom) about which a few other neutral molecules are held
by the electrical attraction of the central ionized molecule. Estimates
of the number of satellite molecules range as high as 12. Also called
light ion, fast ion. Small ions may disappear either by direct
recombination with oppositely charged small ions or by combination with
neutral Aitken nuclei to form new large ions, or by combination with
large ions of opposite sign. The small ion, collectively, is the
principal agent of atmospheric conduction.
