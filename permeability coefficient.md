# Definition

The steady-state rate of a flow of gas through unit area and thickness
of a solid barrier per unit pressure differential at a given
temperature. Also called permeability. Usually expressed in volume or
mass per unit time, per unit area of cross section, per unit thickness,
per unit pressure differential across the barrier.
