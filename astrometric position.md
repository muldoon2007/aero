# Definition

The position of a heavenly body (or space vehicle) on the celestial
sphere corrected for aberration but not for planetary aberration.
Compare apparent position. Astrometric positions are used in
photographic observations where the position of the observed body can be
measured in reference to the positions of comparison stars in the field
of the photograph.
