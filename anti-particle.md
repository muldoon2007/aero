# Definition

Any particle with a charge of opposite sign to the same particle in
normal matters. Thus, the proton has a positive charge; the antiproton,
a negative charge. When a particle and its anti-particle collide, both
may disappear with the creation of lighter particles; this process is
called annihilation .
