# Definition

A hypothetical region in the upper atmosphere in which the distribution
of electron density with height can be described by a theoretical
equation derived by Sydney Chapman. Some of the basic assumptions used
to develop the equation were that the ionizing radiation from the sun is
essentially monochromatic, that the ionized constituent is distributed
exponentially (with a constant scale height), and that there is an
equilibrium condition between the creation of free electrons and their
loss by recombination.
