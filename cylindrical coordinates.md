# Definition

A system of curvilinear coordinates in which the position of a point in
space is determined by (a) its perpendicular distance from a given line,
(b) its distance from a selected reference plane perpendicular to this
line, and (c) its angular distance from a selected reference line when
projected onto this plane. The coordinates thus form the elements of a
cylinder, and, in the usual notation, are written, r, , and z where r is
the radial distance from the cylinder's axis z, and is the angular
position from a reference line in a cylindrical cross section normal to
z. Also called cylindrical polar coordinates, circular cylindrical
coordinates. See polar coordinates. The relations between the
cylindrical coordinates and the rectangular Cartesian coordinates (x, y,
z) are x = r cos , y = r sin , z = z.
