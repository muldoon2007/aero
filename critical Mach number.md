The free-stream Mach number at which a local Mach number of 1.0 is
attained at any point on the body under consideration. For example, an
airplane traveling at a Mach number of 0.8 with respect to the
undisturbed flow might attain Mach number of 1 in the flow about the
wing; the critical Mach number would thus be 0.8.
