# Definition

1.  In atmospheric optics, one of several points in the sky for which
    the degree of polarization of diffuse sky radiation is zero. In an
    ideal Rayleigh atmosphere there would be just two such points, the
    solar point and the antisolar point. Because of effects of multiple
    scattering and because of the action of scattering particles larger
    than molecules, the actual atmosphere is typically found to have
    quite different neutral points. In the vertical plane containing the
    observer's zenith and the sun, three neutral points are commonly
    found: the Arago point, the Babinet point, and the Brewster
    point. 2. In aircraft, that location of the center of gravity at
    which the aircraft would exhibit neutral aerodynamic stability. 3. =
    Lagrangian point.
