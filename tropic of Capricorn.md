# Definition

The southern parallel of declination, approximately 23 degrees 27' from
the celestial equator, reached by the sun at its maximum declination, or
the corresponding parallel on the earth. It is named for the sign of the
zodiac in which the sun reached its maximum southernly declination at
the time the parallel was so named.
