# Definition

A line in a spectrum resulting from a transition from a metastable state
within an atom. Forbidden lines are not found in ordinary sources, but
may be conspicuous in very large bodies of rarefied gas where the time
interval between collisions of atoms is long. Forbidden lines of oxygen
appear, for example, in the aurora.
