# Definition

The equivalence of a quantity of mass m and a quantity of energy E, the
two quantities being related by the mass-energy relation, E = mc2 . This
relation was proposed by Einstein as a consequence of his restricted (or
special) theory of relativity; it has subsequently received abundant
experimental confirmation and is regarded as the conversion factor
relating units of energy and mass; various useful forms of this factor
are: c2 = (2.998 X 1010) 2 centimeters per second = 8.987 X 1022 ergs
per gram = 931.1 million electron volts per atomic mass unit. See
relativity.
