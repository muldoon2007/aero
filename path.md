# Definition

1.  Of a satellite, the projection of the orbital plane on the earth's
    surface, the locus of the satellite subpoint. Since the earth is
    turning under the satellite, the path of a single orbital pass will
    not be a closed curve. Path and track are used interchangeably. On a
    cylindrical map projection, the path is a sine-shaped curve. 2. Of a
    meteor, the projection of the trajectory on the celestial sphere, as
    seen by the observer. 3. = flightpath.
