# Definition

1.  Any of several effects resembling a kind of internal friction,
    accompanied by the generation of heat within the substance affected.
    Magnetic hystersis occurs when a ferromagnetic substance is
    subjected to a varying magnetic intensity; electric hysteresis
    occurs when a dielectric is subjected to a varying electric
    intensity. Elastic hysteresis is the internal friction in an elastic
    solid subjected to varying stress. 2. The delay of an indicator in
    registering a change in a parameter being measured.
