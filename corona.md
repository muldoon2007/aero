# Definition

1.  The outer visible envelope of the sun. Also called solar corona. It
    is observed at solar eclipse or with the coronagraph. The shape of
    the corona varies during the sunspot cycle. At sunspot minimum the
    corona has large extensions along the sun's equator, with short
    brushlike tufts near the poles. At sunspot maximum the equatorial
    extensions are much smaller and the corona is more regular in shape.
    The temperature of the corona appears to be in the vicinity of
    1,000,000� K. 2. The extremely tenuous outer atmosphere of the sun
    now known to extend past the earth's orbit. 3. A set of one or more
    prismatically colored rings of small radii, concentrically
    surrounding the disk of the sun, moon, or other luminary when veiled
    by a thin cloud. The corona is due to diffraction by numerous water
    drops. It can be distinguished from the relatively common halo of
    22� by the much smaller angular diameter of the corona, which is
    often only a few degrees, and by its color sequence, which is from
    blue inside to red outside, the reverse of that in the 22� halo. 4.
