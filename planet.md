# Definition

A celestial body of the solar system, revolving around the sun in a
nearly circular orbit, or a similar body revolving around a star. See
table XII. See also astronomical constant, tables II and III, noting
that some values differ in the three tables. The larger of such bodies
are sometimes called principal planets to distinguish them from
asteroids, planetoids, or minor planets, which are comparatively very
small. The larger planets are accompanied by satellites, such as the
moon. An inferior planet has an orbit smaller than that of the earth.
The four planets nearest the sun are called inner planets; the others,
outer planets. The four largest planets are called major planets. The
four planets commonly used for celestial observations are called
navigational planets. The word planet is of Greek origin, meaning,
literally, wanderer, applied because the planets appear to move relative
to the stars.
