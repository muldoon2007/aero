# Definition

A device which converts thermal energy directly into electrical energy.
In its basic form it consists of two dissimilar metallic electrical
conductors connected in closed loop. Each junction forms a thermocouple.
See thermopile. If the junctions are at different temperatures, an
electrical potentials proportional to the temperature difference will
exist in the circuit; the value of the potential generated is different
for various combinations of materials. For meteorological purposes
couples of copper and constantan are frequently used; these generate
approximately 40 microvolts per degree C of couple temperature
difference.
