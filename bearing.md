# Definition

The horizontal direction of an object or point, usually measured
clockwise from a reference line or direction through 360ï¿½. A bearing is
often designated as true, magnetic, compass, grid, or relative as the
reference direction is true, magnetic, compass, or grid north, or
heading, respectively. At one time bearing was restricted to reference
to the direction of a terrestrial object or point as distinguished from
azimuth which referred to the direction of a celestial body. This
distinction has been blurred by usage.
