# Definition

An empirical generalization that in a gaseous system at constant
pressure, the temperature increase and the relative volume increase
stand in approximately the same proportion for so-called perfect gases.
Mathematically, t - t0 + (1 / c \[ ( v - v0 ) / v0\] where t is
temperature; v is volume; and c is a coefficient of thermal expansion
independent of the particular gas. If the centrigrade temperature scale
is used and v0 is the volume at 0ï¿½ C, then the value of the constant c
is approximately 1/273. Also called Charles law, Gay-Lussac law.
