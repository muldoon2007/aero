# Definition

A vector measure of local rotation in a fluid flow, defined
mathematically as the curl of the velocity vector, Ω = X V where Ω is
the vorticity; V is the velocity; and is the del-operator. The vorticity
component normal to a small plane element is the lime of the circulation
per unit area as the area of the element approaches zero. The vorticity
of a solid rotation is twice the angular velocity vector. In
meteorology, the vorticity usually refers to the vertical component of
the vorticity as defined above.
