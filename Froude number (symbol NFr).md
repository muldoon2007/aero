# Definition

The nondimensional ratio of the inertial force to the force of gravity
for a given fluid flow; the reciprocal of the Reech number. It may be
given as NFr = v2 / lg where v is a characteristic velocity; l a
characteristic length; and g is the acceleration of gravity, or it may
be given as the square root of this number.
