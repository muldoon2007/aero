# Definition

In radar, a display in which a target appears as two horizontal blips,
one extending to the right and one to the left, from a central vertical
time base. When the radar antenna is alined in azimuth at the target
both blips are of equal amplitude. When not correctly pointed the
relative blip amplitude indicates the pointing error. The position of
the signal along the baseline indicates target distance. The display may
be rotated 90 degrees when used for elevation instead of azimuth aiming.
Also called L-scan, L-scope, L-indicator.
