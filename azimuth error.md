# Definition

An error in the indicated azimuth of a target detected by radar,
resulting from horizontal refraction. Compare range error. Inasmush as
significant gradients of index of refraction are very uncommon in the
atmosphere, these errors almost invariably are negligible. Seacoast
areas may give rise on occasion to appreciable horizontal bending of
radio waves because of the contrast of refractive index values between
the air over land and the air over water.
