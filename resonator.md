# Definition

In radio and radar applications, a circuit which will resonate at a
given frequency, or over a range of frequencies, when properly excited.
A very important type of resonator is the cavity resonator, a closed
hollow volume having conducting walls. The frequency at which these
cavities will resonate is a function of their volume and shape; thus,
they are used for making accurate frequency comparisons and for
generating radio frequencies, usually in the microwave region.
