# Definition

In spectroscopy, the relationship between the amount of radiant energy
removed by an absorption line and the number of atoms or molecules of
the absorbing gas in the light path. If the logarithm of energy absorbed
is plotted against the logarithm of amount of gas in the path, the
resulting curve of growth usually has two straight-line segments. The
first, for small absorption and small amounts of gas, has a slope of 1;
the second, for large absorption and large amounts of gas, has a slope
of 1/2. Thus, initially absorption is directly proportional to the
number of atoms or molecules, but as the line becomes more intense,
absorption becomes proportional to the square root of the number of
atoms or molecules. Between these two straight-line segments there is
often a portion in which an increase in the amount of gas in the path
produces very little increase in total absorption. All of this
discussion applies in the case of gaseous emission as well as
absorption.
