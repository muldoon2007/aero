# Definition

A hybrid form of heavier-than-air aircraft that is capable, by virtue of
one or more horizontal rotors or units acting as rotors, of taking off,
hovering, and landing as, or in a fashion similar to, a helicopter, and
once aloft, and moving forward, capable, by means of a mechanical
conversion of one sort or another, of flying purely as a fixed-wing
aircraft, especially in its higher speed ranges.
