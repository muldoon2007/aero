# Definition

The scattering of radiant energy into the hemisphere of space bounded by
a plane normal to the direction of the incident radiation and lying on
the side toward which the incident radiation was advancing; the opposite
of backward scatter. In Rayleigh scattering, forward scatter accounts
for half of the total. As the particle size increases above the Rayleigh
limit, an increasing fraction of the total scattering is forward
scattering.
