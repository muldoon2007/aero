# Definition

A nondimensional parameter used in the theory of heat transfer, defined
by NGr = l3g \[(T1 - T0) / v2T0\] where l is a representative length; T1
and T0 are representative temperatures; g is the acceleration of
gravity; and v is the kinematic viscosity. The Grashof number is
associated with the Reynolds number and the Prandtl number in the study
of convection.
