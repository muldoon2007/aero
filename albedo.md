# Definition

The ratio of the amount of electromagnetic radiation reflected by a body
to the amount incident upon it, often expressed as a percentage, as, the
albedo of the earth is 34% . Compare Bond albedo. The concept defined
above is identical with reflectance. However, albedo is more commonly
used in astronomy and meteorology and reflectance in physics. Albedo is
sometimes used to mean the flux of the reflected radiation as, the earth
albedo is 0.64 calorie per square centimeter. This usage should be
discouraged. The albedo is to be distinguished from the spectral
reflectance which refers to one specific wavelength (monochromatic
radiation). Usage varies somewhat with regard to the exact wavelength
interval implied in albedo figures; sometimes just the visible portion
of the spectrum is considered, sometimes the totality of wavelengths in
the solar spectrum.
