# Definition

1.  Motion of a celestial body in its orbit; circular motion about an
    axis usually external to the body. In some contexts, the terms
    revolution and rotation are used interchangeably but, with reference
    to the motions of a celestial body, revolution refers to motion in
    an orbit or about an axis external to the body, whereas rotation
    refers to motion about an axis within the body. Thus, the earth
    revolves about the sun annually and rotates about its axis daily. 2.
    One complete cycle of the movement of a celestial body in its orbit,
    or of a body about an external axis, as a revolution of the earth
    about the sun.
