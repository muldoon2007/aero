# Definition

1.  Of any particle, the average distance that a particle travels
    between successive collisions with the other particles of an
    ensemble. In vacuum technology, the ensemble of particles of
    interest comprises only the molecules in the gas phase. 2.
    Specifically, the average distance traveled by the molecules of a
    perfect gas between consecutive collisions with one another. It may
    be determined roughly from either of the formulas or where l is the
    mean free path; u (lower case Mu) is the dynamic viscosity; v is the
    kinematic viscosity; p (lower case Rho) is the density; c is the
    molecular speed (a function of the gas temperature); n is the number
    of molecules per unit volume; and d is the molecule diameter. Given
    the mean free path l0 at a level where the pressure is p0 , the
    temperature is T0 (ï¿½K), and the acceleration of gravity is g0, then
    its value at any other level is l = l0 p0 Tg / pT0 g0 where p, T,
    and g are the pressure, temperature, and acceleration of gravity,
    respectively, at the new level. See mixing length. 3. For any
    process the reciprocal of the cross section per unit volume for that
    process.
