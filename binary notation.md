# Definition

A system of positional notation in which the digits are coefficients of
power of the base 2 in same way as the digits in the conventional
decimal system are coefficients of power of the base 10. Binary notation
employs only two digits, 1 and 0, therefore is used extensively in
computers where the on and off positions of a switch or storage device
can represent the two digits. In decimal notation 111 = (1 X 102) + (1 X
101) + (1 x 100) = 100 + 10 + 1 = one hundred and eleven. In binary
notation 111 = (1 x 22) + (1 x 21) + (1 x 20) = 4 + 2 + 1 = seven.
