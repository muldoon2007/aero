# Definition

An equation relating temperature, pressure, and volume of a system in
thermodynamic equilibrium. A large number of such equations have been
devised to apply equally to gaseous and liquid phases throughout a wide
range of temperatures and pressures. Of these, the simplest are the
perfect gas law and Van der Waal equation.
