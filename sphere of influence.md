# Definition

The surface in space about a planet where the ratio of the force with
which the sun perturbs the motion of a particle about the planet, to the
force of attraction of the planet equals the ratio of the force with
which the planet perturbs the motion of a particle about the sun, to the
force of attraction of the sun on the particle. The volume inside this
surface defines the region where the attracting body exerts the primary
influence on a particle.
