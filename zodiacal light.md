# Definition

A faint cone of light extending upward from the horizon in the direction
of the ecliptic (zodiac). It is seen from tropical latitudes for a few
hours after sunset or before sunrise. The spectrum of the zodiacal light
is similar to that of sunlight, so it has been suggested that it is due
to the scattering of sunlight by extraterrestrial dust particles. Some
scattering is also due to electrons.
