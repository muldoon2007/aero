# Definition

(After Ludwig Prandtl, 1875-1953, German scientist). A dimensionless
number representing the ratio of momentum transport to heat transport in
a flow, defined by the equation NPr = μcp/k where μ is the viscosity
coefficient; cp is the specific heat at constant pressure; and k is the
coefficient of thermal conductivity. The Prandtl number may also be
defined as the product of the Reynolds and Peclet numbers.
