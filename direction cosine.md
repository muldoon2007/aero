# Definition

1.  The cosine of the angle formed by the intersection of a line, as a
    line of sight to an orbiting body, with an axis of a rectangular
    coordinate system with the origin on the line. Every line has three
    direction angles and three direction cosines: 1, m, n corresponding
    to , , , the direction angles with the x, y, and z axes. 2.
    Specifically, in tracking, the cosine of the angle between a
    baseline and the line connecting the center of the baseline with the
    target.
