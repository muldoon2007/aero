# Definition

In atmospheric optics, a refraction phenomenon, the opposite of looming,
in which an object on or slightly above the geographic horizon
apparently sinks below it. Compare inferior mirage, stooping. Sinking
occurs whenever the rate of density decreases with height through the
atmosphere is of smaller magnitude than normal or, in extreme cases,
where the density actually increases with height.
