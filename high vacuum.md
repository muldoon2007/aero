# Definition

The condition in a gas-filled space at pressure less than 10-3 torr. The
term high vacuum has frequently been defined as a pressure less than
some upper limit. High vacuum (and similar vacuum terms) should not be
defined as a pressure but rather as the condition or state in a
gas-filled space at pressures less than some upper limit or within
specified limits. The following classification of degrees of high vacuum
has been proposed: Condition Pressure Range high vacuum 10-3 to 10-6
torr very high vacuum 10-6 to 10-9 torr ultrahigh vacuum 10-9 torr and
