# Definition

A substance that contains few or no free charges and which can support
electrostatic stresses. In an electromagnetic field, the centers of the
nonpolar molecules of a dielectric are displaced, and the polar
molecules become oriented close to the field. The net effect is the
appearance of charges at the boundaries of the dielectric. The
frictional work done in orientation absorbs energy from the field which
appears as heat. When the field is removed the orientation is lost by
thermal agitation and so the energy is not regained. If free-charge
carriers are present they too can absorb energy. A good dielectric is
one in which the absorption is a minimum. A vacuum is the only perfect
dielectric. The quality of an imperfect dielectric is its dielectric
strength; and the accumulation of charges within an imperfect dielectric
is termed dielectric absorption.
