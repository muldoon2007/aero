# Definition

Clouds of unknown composition which occur at great heights, 75 to 90
kilometers. They resemble thin cirrus, but usually with a bluish or
silverish color, although sometimes orange to red, standing out against
a dark night sky. Sometimes called luminous clouds. These clouds have
been seen rarely, and then only during twilight, especially with the sun
between 5 and 13 degrees below the horizon; they have been observed only
during summer months in both hemispheres (between latitudes 50 to 75
degrees N and 40 to 60 degrees S), and only in some parts of these
latitude belts.
