# Definition

A method of detection in which a signal is compared, point-to-point,
with an internally generated reference. Also called cross correlation
detection. The output of such a detector is a measure of the degree of
similarity of the input and reference signals. The reference signal is
constructed in such a way that it is at all times a prediction, or best
guess, of what the input signal should be at that time.
