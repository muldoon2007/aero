# Definition

According to relativistic theory, the mass which a body has when it is
at absolute rest. Mass increases when the body is in motion according to
where m is its mass in motion; m0 is its rest mass; v is the body's
speed of motion; and c is the speed of light. Newtonian physics, in
contrast with relativistic physics, makes no distinction between rest
mass and mass in general.
