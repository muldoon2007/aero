# Definition

In an atmosphere, or in any gaseous system, the exchange of fluid
parcels between regions, in apparently random motions of a scale too
small to be treated by the equations of motion. 2. In materials, the
movement of atoms of one material into the crystal lattice of an
adjoining material, e.g.,penetration of the atoms in a ceramic coating
into the lattice of the protected metal. 3. In ion engines, the
migration of neutral atoms through a porous structure incident to
ionization at the emitting surface.
