# Definition

(Pronounced mock, after Ernst Mach, 1838-1916, Austrian scientist). A
number expressing the ratio of the speed of a body or of a point on a
body with respect to the surrounding air or other fluid, or the speed of
a flow, to the speed of sound in the medium; the speed represented by
this number. See Cauchy number. If the Mach number is less than 1, the
flow is called subsonic and local disturbances can propagate ahead of
the flow. If the Mach number is greater than 1, the flow is called
supersonic and disturbances cannot propagate ahead of the flow with the
result that shock waves form. Some authorities use mach number but
engineering practice is to use a capital M in all words and combinations
employing Mach.
