# Definition

The least total refraction experienced by radiation passing through a
prismatic refractive medium. It is important to note that the refractive
deviation is minimal, in general, only with respect to adjacent light
paths, for there may exist a number of path directions through a single
object, each one of which yields a local minimum deviation. When
radiation has undergone minimum deviation, the angular difference in
path directions before and after total refraction is termed the angle of
minimum deviation.
