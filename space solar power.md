# Description

-   aka SSP
-   aka SPS - solar power satellite
-   Provide solar power from satellites beaming energy to earth, usually
    using microwave

-   Type 2, Chinese, gets more attractive if they build a ton of these

## SPS type 4 - simple planar

-   Can only generate electricity around local noon
-   But very simple

## SPS type 6 - SPS-alpha

-   Uses Heliostats

# Market conditions

-   Currently feels like economics and incumbents make it really hard
-   Could be used in niche markets like military
    -   DoD is investing in providing space power for remote vehicles on
        earth so that diesel doesn't need to be trucked in
-   Mankins believes it can be started up for 5-15 billion dollars

# Legal hurdles

-   Insurance
-   Health and safety
-   Spectrum allocation

# History

-   Asimov came up with an idea of an SSP satellite orbiting Mercury
-   1980s, all the work stopped because it was considered too expensive,
    trillions of dollars
-   1990s
    -   Japanese made more progress with electronics improvements
-   Early 2000s
    -   NASA interest declined but there was more interest
        internationally
    -   SPS Alpha - more modular architecture, designed by John Mankins

# FAQ

## Could SSP be weaponized?

-   The laser options could possibly. But generally easier to just build
    a weapon if that's what you want.

## Can it ever compete with terrestrial power?

-   Not in cloudy areas, but yes in Phoenix
    -   There are lots of costs related to transmission

## Can it work for remote areas?

-   Can be competitive down to 10 MW, below that doesn't make sense
    based on the economics

## Can it be done in LEO?

-   No, generally needs to be in GEO because they would "catch the wind"
    in LEO and deorbit in weeks or months
