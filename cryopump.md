# Definition

1.  An exposed surface refrigerated to cryogenic temperature for the
    purpose of pumping gases in a vacuum chamber by condensing the gas
    and maintaining the condensate at a temperature such that the
    equilibrium vapor pressure is equal to or less than the desired
    ultimate pressure in the chamber. 2. The act of removing gases from
    an enclosure by condensing the gases on surfaces at cryogenic
    temperature. Also referred to as a cryogenic pump and not to be
    confused with cryogenic fluid pump for circulating cryogenic
    propellants.
