# Definition

1.  The average velocity or drift velocity that a charged particle in a
    plasma will acquire in response to a unit applied electric field
    when restrained by collisions with other particles. 2. = drift
    mobility. 3. = Hall mobility. In general the electron mobility is
    considerably larger than any ion mobility.
