# Definition

1.  Any organized arrangement in which each component part acts, reacts,
    or interacts in accordance with an overall design inherent in the
    arrangement. 2. Specifically, a major component of a given vehicle
    such as a propulsion system or a guidance system. Usually called a
    major system to distinguish it from the systems subordinate or
    auxiliary to it. The system of sense 1 may become organized by a
    process of evolution, as in the solar system, or by deliberate
    action imposed by the designer, as in a missile system or an
    electrical system. In sense 2, the system embraces all its own
    subsystems including checkout equipment, servicing equipment, and
    associated technicians and attendants. When the term is preceded by
    such designating nouns as propulsion or guidance, it clearly refers
    to a major component of the missile. Without the designating noun,
    the term may become ambiguous. When modified by the word major,
    however, it loses its ambiguity and refers to a major component of
    the missile.
