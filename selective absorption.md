# Definition

Absorption which varies with the wavelength of radiation incident upon
the absorbing substance. See absorption spectrum. A substance which
absorbs in such fashion is called a selective absorber and is to be
contrasted with an ideal black body, white body, or gray body. In
reality, all substances are selective absorbers when due regard is paid
to their interaction with all wavelengths of the complete
electromagnetic spectrum.
