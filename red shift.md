# Definition

In astronomy, the displacement of observed spectral lines toward the
longer wavelengths of the red end of the spectrum. Compare space
reddening. The term red shift is applied both to the Doppler effect
caused by the relative speed of recession of the observed body and the
gravitational or relativistic shift in which the frequency of light
emitted by atoms in stellar atmosphere is decreased by a factor
proportional to the mass-radius relationship of the star.
