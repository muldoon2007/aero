# Definition

1.  A temperature that depends upon some characteristic of some
    substance, such as the melting, boiling, or freezing point, that is
    used as a reference standard of temperature. 2. In physics, usually
    the ice point (0 degrees C); less frequently, the temperature of
    maximum water density (4 degrees C). 3. In meteorology, this has no
    generally accepted meaning, except that it may refer to the
    temperature at zero altitude in the standard atmosphere (15 degrees
    C).
