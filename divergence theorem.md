# Definition

The statement that the volume integral of the divergence of a vector,
such as the velocity U, over the volume V is equal to the surface
integral of the normal component of U over the surface s of the volume,
often called the export through the closed surface, provided U and its
derivatives are continuous and single-valued throughout V and s. This
may be written where n is a unit vector normal to the element of surface
ds, and the symbol indicates that the integration is to be carried out
over a closed surface. This theorem is sometimes called Green's theorem
in the plane for the case of two-dimensional flow, and Green's theorem
in space for the three-dimensional case described above. Also called
Gauss theorem. The divergence theorem is used extensively in
manipulating the meteorological equations of motion and aerodynamic
equations of motion.
