# Definition

A periodic variation of the earth's magnetic field that is in phase with
solar (local) time. The primary source of this variation is the ionizing
effect of solar electromagnetic radiation on the atmosphere coupled with
the earth's rotation. The amplitude of this variation changes with the
seasons and the sunspot cycle.
