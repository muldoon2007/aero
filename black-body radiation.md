# Definition

The electromagnetic radiation emitted by an ideal black body; it is the
theoretical maximum amount of radiant energy of all wavelengths which
can be emitted by a body at a given temperature. The spectral
distribution of black-body radiation is described by Planck law and the
related radiation laws. If a very tiny opening is made into an otherwise
completely enclosed space (hohlraum), the radiation passing out through
this hole when the walls of the enclosure have come to thermal
equilibrium at some temperature will closely approximate ideal
black-body radiation for that temperature.
