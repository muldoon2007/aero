# Definition

Energy transferred by a thermal process. Heat can be measured in terms
of the dynamical units of energy, as the erg, joule, etc., or in terms
of the amount of energy required to produce a definite thermal change in
some substance, as, for example, the energy required per degree to raise
the temperature of a unit mass of water at some temperature ( calorie,
Btu).
