# Definition

An atom or group of atoms broken away from a stable compound by
application of external energy, and, although containing unpaired
electrons, remaining free for transitory or longer periods. Interest
centers on three radicals, atomic hydrogen (H), atomic nitrogen (N), and
the amine radical (NH). In their free state, they are highly active,
combining with each other or with other substances to form other stable
molecules, and yielding in the process energies well in excess of those
available from conventional chemical fuels. Their use in propulsive
systems, depends upon their being isolated and available in bulk, either
in pure form or dissolved in a desired concentration in another fuel.
