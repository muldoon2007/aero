# Definition

Any scheme for representing quantities characterized by the arrangement
of digits in sequence with the understanding that successive digits are
to be interpreted as coefficients of successive powers of an integer
called the base or radix. The base determines the name of the notation,
as, binary (base 2), decimal (base 10), or duodecimal (base 12).
