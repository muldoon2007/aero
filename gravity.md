# Definition

1.  Viewed from a frame of reference fixed in the earth, force imparted
    by the earth to a mass which is at rest relative to the earth. Since
    the earth is rotating, the force observed as gravity is the
    resultant of the force of gravitation and the centrifugal force
    arising from this rotation and the use of an earthbound rotating
    frame of reference. It is directed normal to sea level and to its
    geopotential surfaces. See virtual gravity, geopotential height,
    standard gravity. The magnitude of the force of gravity at sea level
    decreases from the poles, where the centrifugal force is zero, to
    the equator, where the centrifugal force is a maximum but directed
    opposite to the force of gravitation. This difference is accentuated
    by the shape of the earth, which is nearly that of an oblate
    spheroid of revolution slightly depressed at the poles. Also,
    because of the asymmetric distribution of the mass of the earth, the
    force of gravity is not directed precisely toward the earth's
    center. The magnitude of the force of gravity is usually called
    either gravity, acceleration of gravity, or apparent gravity. 2. =
    acceleration of gravity. 3. By extension, the attraction of any
    heavenly body for any mass; as Martian gravity.
