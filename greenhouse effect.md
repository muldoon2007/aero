# Definition

The heating effect exerted by the atmosphere upon the earth by virtue of
the fact that the atmosphere (mainly, its water vapor) absorbs and
remits infrared radiation. In detail: the shorter wavelengths of
insolation are transmitted rather freely through the atmosphere to be
absorbed at the earth's surface. The earth then reemits this as
long-wave (infrared) terrestrial radiation, a portion of which is
absorbed by the atmosphere and again emitted (see atmospheric
radiation). Some of this is emitted downward back to the earth's surface
( counter-radiation). The mean surface temperature for the entire world,
14 degrees C, is almost 40 degrees C higher than the mean temperature
required for radiative equilibrium of a black body at the earth's mean
distance from the sun. It is essential, in understanding the concept of
the greenhouse effect, to note that the important additional warming is
due to the counterradiation from the atmosphere. The glass panes of a
greenhouse function in this manner, hence the name.
