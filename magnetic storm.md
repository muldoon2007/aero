# Definition

A worldwide disturbance of the earth's magnetic field. See M-region.
Magnetic storms are frequently characterized by a sudden onset, in which
the magnetic field undergoes marked changes in the course of an hour or
less, followed by a very gradual return to normality, which may take
several days. Magnetic storms are caused by solar disturbances, though
the exact nature of the link between the solar and terrestrial
disturbances is not understood. They are more frequent during years of
high sunspot number. Sometimes a magnetic storm can be linked to a
particular solar disturbance. In these cases, the time between solar
flare and onset of the magnetic storm is about 1 or 2 days, suggesting
that the disturbance is carried to the earth by a cloud of particles
thrown out by the sun. When these disturbances are observable only in
the auroral zones, they may be termed polar magnetic storms.
