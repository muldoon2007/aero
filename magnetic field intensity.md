# Definition

The magnetic force exerted on an imaginary unit magnetic pole placed at
any specified point of space. It is a vector quantity. Its direction is
taken as the direction toward which a north magnetic pole would tend to
move under the influence of the field. If the force is measured in dynes
and the unit pole is a cgs unit pole, the field intensity is given in
oersteds. Also called magnetic intensity, magnetic field, magnetic field
strength. Prior to 1932 the oersted was called the gauss; but the latter
term is now used to measure magnetic induction (within magnetic
materials), whereas oersted is reserved for magnetic force. By
definition, one magnetic line of force per square centimeter (in air)
represents the field intensity of 1 oersted.
