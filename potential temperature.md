# Definition

The temperature a parcel of dry air would have if brought adiabatically
from its initial state to the (arbitrarily selected) standard pressure
of 1000 millibars. Its mathematical expression is θ = T(1000/p)R/cp
where θ is the potential temperature; T is the Kelvin temperature; p is
pressure, millibars; R is the gas constant for dry air; and cp is the
specific heat or dry air at constant pressure. See equivalent potential
temperature, adiabatic process.
