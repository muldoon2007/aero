- # Definition
  
  The equations of motion for a viscous fluid which may be written where p
  is the pressure; œÅ is the density; t is the time; F is the total
  external force; N is the fluid velocity; and v is the kinematic
  viscosity. For an incompressible fluid, the term in . N (divergence)
  vanishes and the effects of viscosity then play a role analogous to that
  of temperature in thermal conduction and to that of density in simple
  diffusion. See viscosity, Ekman spiral.
- Solutions of the Navier-Stokes
  equations have been obtained only in a limited number of special cases.
  The equations are derived on the basis of certain simplifying
  assumptions concerning the stress tensor of the fluid; in one dimension
  they represent the assumption referred to as the Newtonian friction law.
