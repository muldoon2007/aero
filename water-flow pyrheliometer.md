# Definition

An absolute pyrheliometer, developed by C. G. Abbot, in which the
radiation-sensing element is a blackened water calorimeter. It consists
of a cylinder blackened on the interior and surrounded by a special
chamber through which water flows at a constant rate. The temperatures
of the incoming and outgoing water, which are monitored continuously by
thermometers, are used to compute the intensity of the radiation. This
instrument is used by the Smithsonian Institution as its standard
instrument.
