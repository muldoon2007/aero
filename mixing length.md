# Definition

A mean length of travel, characteristic of a particular motion in a
fluid over which an eddy maintains its identity; analogous to the mean
free path of a molecule. Physically, the idea implies that mixing occurs
by discontinuous steps, that fluctuations which arise as eddies with
different characteristics wander about, and that the mixing is done
almost entirely by the small eddies.
