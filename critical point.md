# Definition

The thermodynamic state in which liquid and gas phases of a substance
coexist in equilibrium at the highest possible temperature. At higher
temperatures than the critical no liquid phase can exist. For water
substance the critical point is Ps = 2.21 X 10 5 millibars T = 647ï¿½ K v
= 3.10 grams/cubic centimeter where Ps is the saturation vapor pressure
of the water vapor; T is the Kelvin temperature; and v is the specific
volume.
