# Definition

The microscopic particles in the atmosphere which serve as condensation
nuclei for droplet growth during the rapid adiabatic expansion produced
by an Aitken dust counter. These nuclei are both solid and liquid
particles whose diameters are of the order of tenths of microns or even
smaller. The Aitken nuclei play an important role in atmospheric
electrical processes, for they are the particles which capture (by
adsorption or other surface electrical processes) small ions and thereby
form large ions. In air containing large numbers of Aitken nuclei, the
small ion population is small, the large ion population is large, and
the air conductivity is low.
