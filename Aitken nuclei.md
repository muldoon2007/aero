	- The microscopic particles in the atmosphere which serve as condensation
	  nuclei for droplet growth during the rapid adiabatic expansion produced
	  by an [[Aitken dust counter]]. These nuclei are both solid and liquid
	  particles whose diameters are of the order of tenths of microns or even
	  smaller. The Aitken nuclei play an important role in atmospheric
	  electrical processes, for they are the particles which capture (by
	  adsorption or other surface electrical processes) small ions and thereby
	  form large ions. In air containing large numbers of Aitken nuclei, the
	  small ion population is small, the large ion population is large, and
	  the air conductivity is low.
