# Definition

A nonambiguous spherical and elliptical, long-baseline, range-only
trajectory measuring system utilizing phase comparison techniques with
range modulation frequencies. The system consists of three of more
receivers which track a transponder interrogated by a signal
transmitter. The reference signal from the ground transmitter is also
received by the ground receivers. Simultaneous range measurements are
made by the ground receivers, which are correlated with base timing from
which space position can be computed by triangulation. The system
operates on 387 and 417 megacycles.
