# Definition

A saturation-adiabatic process in which the condensed water substance is
removed from the system, and therefore best treated by the
thermodynamics of open systems. See adiabatic process. Meteorologically,
this process corresponds to rising air from which the moisture is
precipitating. Descent of air so lifted becomes by definition a
dry-adiabatic process.
