# Definition

A scalar equal to the product of the magnitudes of any two vectors and
the cosine of the angle θ between their positive directions. Also called
dot product, direct product, inner product. See vector product. For two
vectors A and B, the scalar product is most commonly written A . B, read
A dot B, and occasionally as (AB). If the vectors A and B have the
components Ax, Bx, Ay, By, and Az, Bz along rectangular Cartesian, x, y,
and z axes, respectively, then A . B = AxBx + AyBy + AzBz =
\|A\|\|B\|cosθ = AB cosθ If a scalar product is zero, one of the vectors
is zero or else the two are perpendicular.
