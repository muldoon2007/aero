# Definition

1.  A straight line intersecting a circle or other curve, or a straight
    line connecting the ends of an arc. 2. (symbol c). In aeronautics, a
    straight line intersecting or touching an airfoil profile at two
    points; specifically, that part of such a line between two points of
    intersection. This line is usually a datum line joining the leading
    and trailing edges of an airfoil, joining the ends of the mean line
    of an airfoil profile, from which the ordinates and angles of the
    airfoil are measured. As such a datum line, it is sometimes called
    the geometric chord, to distinguish it from a chord established on
    the basis of any other considerations. 3. = chord length. In sense
    3, points or stations along a chord are designated in percentages or
    fractions of the chord or chord length from the leading edge, as, a
    point at 25 percent, or one-quarter, chord.
