# Definition

The general name for any instrument used to measure the intensity of
radiant energy, particularly that of the sun. See actinometry. See also
bolometer, dosimeter, photometer, radiometer. Actinometers may be
classified, according to the quantities which they measure, in the
following manner: (a) pyrheliometer, which measures the intensity of
direct solar radiation; (b) pyranometer, which measure global radiation
(the combined intensity of direct solar radiation and diffuse sky
radiation); and (c) pyrgeometer, which measures the effective
terrestrial radiation.
