# Definition

1.  A given space filled with gas at pressures below atmospheric
    pressure. Various approximate ranges are: low vacuum, torr 760 to
    25; medium vacuum, torr 25 to 10-3; high vacuum, torr 10-3 to 10-6;
    very high vacuum, torr 10-6 to 10-9; ultrahigh vacuum, torr 10-9 and
    below. 2. In reference to satellite orbital parameters, without
    consideration of the perturbing effects of an atmosphere, as in
    vacuum perigee, vacuum apogee.
