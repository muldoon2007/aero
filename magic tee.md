# Definition

A compound waveguide or coaxial tee with four arms which exhibits
directional characteristics, when properly matched, so that a signal
entering one arm will be split between two of the other arms but not the
third. A signal entering another arm is likewise split with half the
energy entering one of the arms common to the other input but not its
second arm and the other half of the energy entering the arm not used by
the other input. The magic tee is used in radar as a
transmitter-receiver duplexer.
