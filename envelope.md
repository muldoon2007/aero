# Definition

1.  Of a variable, a curve which bounds the values which the variable
    can assume, but does not consider possible simultaneous occurrences
    or correlations between different values. 2. The bounds within which
    a certain system can operate as a flight envelope, especially a
    graphic representation of these bounds showing interrelationships of
    operational parameters.
