1.  In computer operations, a plan for the solution of a problem. 2. To
    create a plan for the solution of a problem. A complete program
    includes plans for the transcription of data, coding for the
    computer, and plans for the absorption of the results into the
    system. The list of coded instructions, called a routine, plans a
    computation or process from the asking of a question to the delivery
    of the result, including the integration of the operation into an
    existing system. Thus, programming consists of planning and coding,
    including numerical analysis, systems analysis, specification of
    printing formats, and any other functions necessary to the
    integration of a computer in a system.
