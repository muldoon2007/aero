# Definition

1.  The elliptic partial differential equation where is a scalar
    function of position, and 2 is the Laplacian operator. In
    rectangular Cartesina coordinates x, y, z , this equation may be
    written The Laplace equation is satisfied, for example, by the
    velocity potential in an irrotational flow, by gravitational
    potential in free space, by electrostatic potential in the steady
    flow of electric currents in solid conductors, and by the
    steady-state temperature distribution in solids. A solution of the
    Laplace equation is called a harmonic function. Compare Poisson
    equation. 2. An equation for the speed of sound. See Laplacian speed
    of sound.
