# Definition

The flux (rate of flow) of any quantity, usually a form of energy,
through a unit area of specified surface. (Note that this is not a
volumetric density like radiant density.) Compare luminous density. In
radar, flux density commonly is referred to as power density. It is
essential to understand that the flux density of radiation is in no
sense a vector quantity, because it is the sum of the flux corresponding
to all ray directions incident upon one side of the unit area.
