# Definition

A realistic curve having a least-squares fit to the data points. There
are an infinity of least-squares curves to fit a set of data points (one
curve of which touches every point). Therefore, the regression curve
must be the best least-squares estimate (of the true curve of the
phenomenon observed) that can be made in light of the data and prior
knowledge of the physics of the phenomenon observed. Note that a
regression curve is offset from the true curve by the amount of any bias
error and of most systematic errors.
