# Definition

The angular difference, at any place, between the direction of plumb
line (the vertical) and the perpendicular (the normal) to the reference
spheroid. This difference seldom exceeds 30 seconds of arc. Also called
station error. When measured at the earth's surface the deflection of
the vertical is equal to the angle between the geoid and the reference
spheroid.
