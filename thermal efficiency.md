1.  The efficiency with which a heat engine transforms the potential
    heat of its fuel into work or output, expressed as the ratio of the
    useful work done by the engine in a given time interval to the total
    heat energy contained in the fuel burned during the same time
    interval, both work and heat being expressed in the same units. 2. =
    thermodynamic efficiency.
