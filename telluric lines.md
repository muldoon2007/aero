# Definition

Absorption lines in a solar spectrum produced by constituents of the
atmosphere of the earth itself rather than by gases in the outer solar
atmosphere such as those responsible for the Fraunhofer lines. The
terrestrial nature of the absorption processes responsible for telluric
lines is revealed by their intensity variation with solar zenith angle
and by their freedom from any Doppler broadening due to their solar
rotation. Water vapor produces the strongest of the telluric lines in
the visible spectrum.
