# Definition

An ideal, perfectly homogeneous medium possessing a dielectric constant
of unity and in which there is nothing to reflect, refract or absorb
energy. A perfect vacuum possesses these qualities. Compare homogeneous
atmosphere. Radio signal strength measurements are often expressed in
terms of decibels above or below free-space values at a given distance
from the transmitter. A free-space radiation pattern would show only the
minor and major lobes of the antenna and not the interference pattern
normally produced by reflection from the earth's surface.
