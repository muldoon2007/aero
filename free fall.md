1.  The fall or drop of a body, such as a rocket, not guided, not under
    thrust, and not retarded by a parachute or other braking device. 2.
    The free and unhampered motion of a body along a Keplerian
    trajectory, in which the force of gravity is counterbalanced by the
    force of inertia. See weightlessness.
