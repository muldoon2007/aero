# Definition

In celestial mechanics, a circumscribing circle to an orbital ellipse
with a radius a, the semimajor axis. The auxiliary circle is related to
the ellipse by QN = Q'N(1 - e2)1/2 where e is the eccentricity; Q is any
point on the ellipse; N is the foot of the perpendicular through Q to
the line of apsides; and Q' is the intersection of the perpendicular and
the auxiliary circle.
