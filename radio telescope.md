# Definition

A device for receiving, amplifying, and measuring the intensity of radio
waves originating outside the earth's atmosphere or reflected from a
body outside the atmosphere. A radio telescope usually includes a source
of radiation of known power for calibration of the received signal. The
term radio telescope is not restricted to devices incorporating a
paraboloidal dish antenna. A radio telescope can use any antenna or
combination of antennas which will accept the radiation being studied.
