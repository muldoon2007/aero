# Definition

A turbojet engine in which additional propulsive thrust is gained by
extending a portion of the compressor or turbine blades outside the
inner engine case. The extended blades propel bypass air flows along the
engine axis but between the inner and outer engine casing. This air is
not combusted but does provide additional thrust caused by the
propulsive effect imparted to it by the extended compressor blading.
