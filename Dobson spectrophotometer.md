# Definition

A photoelectric spectrophotometer which is used in the determination of
the ozone content of the atmosphere. The instrument compares the solar
energy at two wavelengths in the absorption band of ozone by permitting
the two radiations to fall alternately upon a photocell. The stronger
radiation is then attenuated by an optical wedge until the photoelectric
system of the photometer indicates equality of incident radiation. The
ratio of radiation intensity is obtained by this process and the ozone
content of the atmosphere is computed from the ratio.
