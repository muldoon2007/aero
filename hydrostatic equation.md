# Definition

In numerical equations, the form assumed by the vertical component of
the vector equation of motion when all coriolis, earth- curvature,
frictional, and vertical-acceleration terms are considered negligible
compared with those involving the vertical pressure force and the force
of gravity. Thus, dP = -pgdZ where P is the atmospheric pressure; p is
the density; g is the acceleration of gravity; and Z is the geometric
light. For cyclonic-scale motions the error committed in applying the
hydrostatic equation to the earth's atmosphere is less than 0.01
percent. Strong vertical accelerations in thunderstorms and mountain
waves may be 1 percent of gravity or more in extreme situations.
