# Definition

The difference between consecutive daily mean values of the horizontal
component of the geomagnetic field. Also called U-figure. See u-index.
Each value is derived from a 48-hour interval covering 2
Greenwich-mean-time days, and is assigned to the second day of the pair.
The monthly U-index, the mean of the daily values, is the most
frequently used.
