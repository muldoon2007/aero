# Definition

Turbulence in which the products and squares of the velocity components
and their derivatives are independent of direction, or, more precisely,
invariant with respect to rotation and reflection of the coordinate axes
in a coordinate system moving with the mean motion of the fluid. Then
all the normal stresses are equal and the tangential stresses are zero.
Atmospheric turbulence is generally nonisotropic, although isotropic
turbulence is that most easily produced in wind tunnel experiments and
forms the basis of much of the theoretical analysis of turbulent flow. A
related but less restricted type of turbulence is known as homologous
turbulence, in which the fluctuations differ only in scale at every
point in the flow.
