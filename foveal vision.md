# Definition

Vision in which the eye is so oriented toward the pertinent light source
as to have the light fall upon that central portion of the retina called
the fovea. Also called photopic vision. Foveal vision permits much
higher resolution than does parafoveal vision and is the normal mode of
seeing under daytime conditions.
