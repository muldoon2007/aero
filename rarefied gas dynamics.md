# Definition

The study of the phenomena related to the molecular or noncontinuum
nature of gas flow at densities where 位 / l \> 0.01 where 位 is molecular
mean free path and l is a characteristic dimension of the flow field.
Flow with 位 / l \> 0.01 is called molecular flow. Flow with 位 / l 10 is
called free molecule flow. Slip flow and transition flow are not always
distinguished from each other. The value 1 is sometimes used instead of
10 as the boundary value for transition flow and free molecule flow.
