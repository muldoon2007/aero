# Definition

Angular distance from a celestial pole; the arc of an hour circle
between a celestial pole, usually the elevated pole, and a point on the
celestial sphere, measured from the celestial pole through 180 degrees.
If the declination, d, and the celestial pole are of the same name, the
polar distance is 90 degrees - d, but if of contrary name, it is 90
degrees + d. See codeclination.
