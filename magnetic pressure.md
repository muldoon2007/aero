# Definition

The energy density associated with a magnetic field. In a very real
sense, there is energy stored in a magnetic field, and since energy per
unit volume is equivalent to force per unit area or pressure, one may
speak of the pressure exerted by a magnetic field. For plasma
containment in a thermonuclear device, the magnetic pressure must be
greater than the kinetic pressure of the plasma. See beta factor. A
pressure of 1 atmosphere corresponds approximately to 5,000 gausses, and
the pressure is proportional to the square of the field.
