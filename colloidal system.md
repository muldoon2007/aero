# Definition

An intimate mixture of two substances one of which, called the dispersed
phase (or colloid ) is uniformly distributed in a finely divided state
through the second substance, called the dispersion medium (or
dispersing medium ). The dispersion medium may be a gas, a liquid, or a
solid, and the dispersed phase may also be any of these, with the
exception that one does not speak of a colloidal system of one gas in
another. Also called colloidal dispersion, colloidal suspension. A
system of liquid or solid particles colloidally dispersed in a gas is
called an aerosol. A system of solid substance or water-insoluble liquid
colloidally dispersed in liquid water is called a hydrosol. There is no
sharp line of demarcation between true solutions and colloidal system on
the one hand, or between mere suspensions and colloidal systems on the
other. When the particles of the dispersed phase are smaller than about
1 millimicron in diameter, the system begins to assume the properties of
a true solution; when the particles dispersed are much greater than 1
micron, separation of the dispersed phase from the dispersing medium
becomes so rapid that the system is best regarded as a suspension.
