# Definition

Decrease of a radioactive substance because of nuclear emission of alpha
or beta particles, positrons, or gamma rays. See radioactivity. In beta
decay, for example, the emission of a -particle, i.e., an electron,
causes radioactive change into a daughter element of the same atomic
weight as the parent element but of atomic number higher by 1.
