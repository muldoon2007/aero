# Definition

1.  A variation of a quantity whose value is normally constant; this
    variation is characterized by a rise and a decay, and has a finite
    duration. The word pulse normally refers to a variation in time;
    when the variation is in some other dimensions, it should be so
    specified, such as space pulse. This definition is so broad that it
    covers almost any transient phenomenon. The only features common to
    all pulses are rise, finite duration, and decay. It is necessary
    that the rise, duration, and decay be of a quantity that is constant
    (not necessarily zero) for sometime before the pulse and has the
    same constant value for some time afterwards. The quantity has a
    normally constant value and is perturbed during the pulse. No
    relative time scale can be assigned. 2. Radar, sense 2. 3. The
    intermittent change in the shape of an artery due to an increase in
    the tension of its walls following the contraction of the heart. The
    pulse is usually counted at the wrist (radial pulse), but may be
    taken over any artery that can be felt.
