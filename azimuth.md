# Definition

1.  Horizontal direction or bearing. Compare azimuth angle. 2. In
    navigation, the horizontal direction of a celestial point from a
    terrestrial point, expressed as the angular distance from a
    reference direction, usually measured from 0째 at the reference
    direction clockwise through 360째. An azimuth is often designated as
    true, magnetic, compass, grid, or relative as the reference
    direction is true, magnetic, compass, grid north, or heading,
    respectively. Unless otherwise specified, the term is generally
    understood to apply to true azimuth, which may be further defined as
    the arc of the horizon, or the angle at the zenith, between the
    north part of the celestial meridian or principal vertical circle
    and a vertical circle, measured from 0째 at the north part of the
    principal vertical circle clockwise through 360째. 3. In astronomy,
    the direction of a celestial point from a terrestrial point measured
    clockwise from the north or the south point of the meridian plane.
    See horizon system. 4. In surveying, the horizontal direction of an
    object measured clockwise from the south point of the meridian
    plane. In surveying, an azimuth of a celestial body is called an
    astronomic azimuth.
