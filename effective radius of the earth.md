# Definition

A fictitious value for the radius of the earth, used in place of the
geometrical radius to correct for atmospheric refraction when the index
of refraction in the atmosphere changes linearly with height. See
modified index of refraction. Under conditions of standard refraction
the effective radius of the earth is 8.5 \* 106 meters, or four-thirds
the geometrical radius. If the effective radius is used in ray tracing
diagrams, the rays may be drawn as though they were traveling in
straight lines.
