# Definition

In photometry, a measure of the intrinsic luminous intensity emitted by
a source in a given direction; the illuminance produced by light from
the source upon a unit surface area oriented normal to the line of sight
at any distance from the source, divided by the solid angle subtended by
the source at the receiving surface. Also called brightness but
luminance is preferred. See Lambert law. Compare luminous emittance. It
is assumed that the medium between source and receiver is perfectly
transparent; therefore, luminance is independent of extinction between
source and receiver. The source may or may not be self-luminous.
Luminance is a measure only of light; the comparable term for
electromagnetic radiation in general is radiance.
