# Definition

1.  In antenna design, the ratio of the received power available at the
    terminals of an antenna to the power per unit area in the incident
    wave. For all antennas, effective area A is related to gain G at a
    given wavelength by the equation: A / G = 2 / 4 Also called
    effective aperture. See aperture. The effective area of an ideal
    antenna is equal to its physical area S. In practice, A/S for
    microwave antennas is always less than one, a representative value
    for paraboloids being 0.6. 2. Same as scattering cross section.
