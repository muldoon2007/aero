# Definition

For a specified signal, the minimum effective sound pressure level of
the signal that is capable of evoking an auditory sensation in a
specified fraction of the trials. The characteristics of the signal, the
manner in which it is presented to the listener, and the point at which
the sound pressure level is measured must be specified. Also called
threshold of detectability. Unless otherwise indicated, the ambient
noise reaching the ears is assumed to be negligible. The threshold is
usually given as a sound pressure level in decibels, relative to 0.0002
microbar. Instead of the method of constant stimuli, which is implied by
the phrase a specified fraction of the trials , another psychophysical
method (which should be specified) may be employed.
