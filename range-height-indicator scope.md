# Definition

(abbr RHI-scope). A type of radar indicator (radar-scope); an
intensity-modulated indicator on which echoes are displayed in
coordinates of slant range and elevation angle, simulating, thereby, a
vertical cross section of the atmosphere along some azimuth from the
radar. The power of the signal returned from the target is used to
modulate the intensity of the electron beam.
