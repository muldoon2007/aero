# Definition

A period of one revolution of the earth around the sun. The period of
one revolution with respect to the vernal equinox, averaging 365 days 5
hours 48 minutes 45.68 seconds in 1955, is called a tropical,
astronomical, equinoctial, natural, or solar year. The period with
respect to the stars, averaging 365 days 6 hours 9 minutes 9.55 seconds
in 1955, is called a sidereal year. The period of revolution from
perihelion to perihelion, averaging 365 days 6 hours 13 minutes 53.16
seconds in 1955, is an anomalistic year. The period between successive
returns of the sun to a sidereal hour angle of 80 degrees is called a
fictitious or Besselian year. A civil year is the calendar year of 365
days in common years, or 366 days in leap years. A light year is a unit
of length equal to the distance light travels in one year, 9.460 X 10E12
kilometers. The term year is occasionally applied to other intervals
such as an eclipse year, the interval between two successive
conjunctions of the sun with the same node of the moon's orbit, a period
averaging 346 days 14 hours 52 minutes 52.23 seconds in 1955, or a great
or Platonic year, the period of one complete cycle of the equinoxes
around the ecliptic, about 25,800 years.
