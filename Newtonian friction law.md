# Definition

The statement that the tangential force (i.e., the force in the
direction of the flow) per unit area acting at an arbitrary level within
a fluid contained between two rigid horizontal plates, one of which is
motionless and the other of which is in steady motion, is proportional
to the shear of the fluid motion at that level. Mathematically, the law
is given by Τ = μ( u / z) where Τ is the tangential force per unit area,
usually called the shearing stress; μ is a constant of proportionally
called the dynamic viscosity; and u/z is the shear of the fluid flow
normal to the resting plate. Also called Newton formula for the stress.
