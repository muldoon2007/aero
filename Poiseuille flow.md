# Definition

The steady laminar flow of a fluid through a narrow horizontal circular
cylinder according to the relation u = (1/4μ) (p/x) (a2 - r2 where u is
the fluid velocity along the cylinder's axis at a distance r from the
cylinder's axis; μ is the dynamic viscosity of the fluid; a is the
cylinder radius; and p/x is the pressure gradient along the axis of the
cylinder. The velocity profile across the cylinder is seen to be
parabolic, and this relation affords a convenient experimental means of
determining a fluid's viscosity. Also called Hagen-Poiseuille flow.
Compare Couette flow.
