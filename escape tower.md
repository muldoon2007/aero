# Definition

A trestle tower place on top of a space capsule, which during liftoff
connects the capsule to the escape rocket. The escape tower is of such
length as to protect the capsule from the heat of the escape rocket in
case the rocket is used to separate the capsule from the booster vehicle
during ascent. The tower is ultimately separated from the capsule if
ascent is normal.
