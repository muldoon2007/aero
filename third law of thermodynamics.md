# Definition

The statement that every substance has a finite positive entropy, and
that the entropy of a crystalline substance is zero at the temperature
of absolute zero. See thermodynamic probability. Modern quantum theory
has shown that the entropy of crystals at 0 degrees absolute is not
necessarily zero. If the crystal has any asymmetry, it may exist in more
than one state; and there is, in addition, an entropy residue deriving
from nuclear spin.
