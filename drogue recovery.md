# Definition

A type of recovery system for space vehicles or space capsules after
initial reentry into the atmosphere using deployment of on ore more
small parachutes to diminish speed, to reduce aerodynamic heating, and
to stabilize the vehicle so that larger recovery parachutes can be
safely deployed at lower altitudes without too great an opening shock.
