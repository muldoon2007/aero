# Definition

The approximate equality of positive and negative particles in
high-density plasmas. This phenomenon, which is sometimes called
electrical neutrality, is a result of the extremely large electric space
charge fields that would arise if the densities were not equal. Although
the positive and negative charge densities are seldom exactly equal,
their percentage difference is so small as to be negligible. It is not
difficult to maintain this condition in an active plasma since
ionization or recombination always produces or destroys an ion pair
together.
