# Definition

A device which has the necessary impedance characteristics of an antenna
and the necessary power-handling capabilities, but which does not
radiate or receive radio waves. Also called artificial antenna. In
receiver practice, that portion of the impedance not included in the
signal generator is often called dummy antenna.
