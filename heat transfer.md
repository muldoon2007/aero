# Definition

The transfer or exchange of heat by radiation, conduction, or convection
within a substance and between the substance and its surroundings.
Radiation represents the transfer of radiant energy from one region to
another by electromagnetic waves, with or without an intervening medium.
Conduction, or diffusion of heat, implies the elastic impact of fluid
molecules, without any net transfer of matter. Convection arises from
the mixing of relatively large volumes of fluid because of the fluid
motion and may be due either to local temperature inequalities (free
convection) or to an applied pressure gradient (forced convection).
