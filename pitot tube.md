(Pronounced pee-toe. After Henri Pitot, 1695-1771, French scientist.) An
open-ended tube or tube arrangement which, when immersed in a moving
fluid with its mouth pointed upstream, may be used to measure the
stagnation pressure of the fluid for subsonic flow; or the stagnation
pressure behind the tube's normal shock wave for supersonic flow.
