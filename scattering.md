# Definition

The process by which small particles suspended in a medium of a
different index of refraction diffuse a portion of the incident
radiation in all directions. In scattering, no energy transformation
results, only a change in the spatial distribution of the radiation.
Also called scatter. Along with absorption, scattering is a major cause
of the attenuation of radiation by the atmosphere. Scattering varies as
a function of the ratio of the particle diameter to the wavelength of
the radiation. When this ratio is less than about one-tenth, Rayleigh
scattering occurs in which the scattering coefficient varies inversely
as the fourth power of the wavelength. At larger values of the ratio of
particle diameter to wavelength, the scattering varies in a complex
fashion described by the Mie theory; at a ratio of the order of 10, the
laws of geometric optics begin to apply.
