The various appearances of the moon during different parts of the
synodical month. The cycle begins with new moon or change of the moon at
conjunction. The visible part of the waxing moon increases in size
during the first half of the cycle until full moon appears at
opposition, after which the visible part of the waning moon decreases
for the remainder of the cycle. First quarter occurs when the waxing
moon is at east quadrature; last quarter when the waning moon is at west
quadrature. From last quarter to new and from new to first quarter, the
moon is crescent; from first quarter to full and from full to last
quarter, it is gibbous. The elapsed time, usually expressed in days
since the last new moon, is called age of the moon.
