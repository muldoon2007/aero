# Definition

The theory of propagation of electromagnetic radiation through a medium
containing ions in the presence of an external magnetic field. It
applies to the propagation of radio waves in the ionosphere, and
provides theoretical relationships among such aspects of the subject as
the index of refraction, radiofrequency, free-electron density, electron
collision frequency, the earth's magnetic field (components relative to
the direction of propagation), the nature of polarization, etc. See
magnetic double refraction.
