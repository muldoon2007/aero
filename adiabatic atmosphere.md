# Definition

A model atmosphere in which the pressure decreases with height according
to: p = p0\[1 - (-gz/cp,dT0)\] Cp,dRd where p0 and T0 are the pressure
and temperature (Â° K) at sea level or other datum; z is the geometric
height; Rd is the gas constant for dry gas; cp,d is the specific heat
for dry gas at constant pressure; and g is the acceleration of gravity.
Also called dry-adiabatic atmosphere, convective atmosphere, homogeneous
atmosphere . See homogeneous atmosphere, barotropy.
