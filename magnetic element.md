# Definition

1.  In terrestrial magnetism, any of the following measurements: the
    vector magnetic field, also called total field (symbol ); the scalar
    intensity of the total field ( symbol F); declination, also called
    variation ( symbol D); the intensity of the horizontal component of
    the earth's field ( symbol H); the intensity of the vertical
    component ( symbol Z), taken as positive downward; the inclination
    or dip ( symbol I); the angle between and H; the intensity of the
    component of the horizontal field in the geographic north direction
    ( symbol X); and the intensity of the component of the horizontal
    field in the geographic east direction. 2. That part of an
    instrument producing or influenced by magnetism.
