# Definition

1.  In general, any quantity of a problem that is not an independent
    variable. More specifically, the term is often used to distinguish,
    from dependent variables, quantities which may be assigned more or
    less arbitrary values for purposes of the problem at hand. 2. In
    statistical terminology, any numerical constant derived from a
    population or a probability distribution. Specifically, it is an
    arbitrary constant in the mathematical expression of a probability
    distribution. For example, in the distribution given by f(z) = αe-αx
    the constant α is a parameter. 3. In celestial mechanics , the
    semi-latus rectum.
