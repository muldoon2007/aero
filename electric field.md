# Definition

1.  A region in which a charged particle would experience an electrical
    force; the geometric array of the imaginary electric lines of force
    that exist in relation to points of opposite charge. An electric
    field is a vector field in which magnitude of the vector is the
    electric-field strength and the vector is parallel to the lines of
    force. 2. = electric-field strength. See atmospheric electric field.
