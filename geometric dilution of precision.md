# Definition

(abbr GDOP). As applied to a trajectory measuring system, the increase
in error of calculated space position which is caused by the location of
the measured position relative to the system. This is an increase which
is caused solely by the geometry of the problem and assumes that all
basic measurements maintain a constant accuracy.
