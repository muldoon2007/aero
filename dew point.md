# Definition

The temperature to which a given parcel of air must be cooled at
constant pressure and constant water-vapor content in order for
saturation to occur; the temperature at which the saturation vapor
pressure of the parcel is equal to the actual vapor pressure of the
contained water vapor. Any further cooling usually results in the
formation of dew or frost. Also called dewpoint temperature. When this
temperature is below 0ï¿½ C, it is sometimes called the frost point.
