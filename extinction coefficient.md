# Definition

In meteorology, a measure of the space rate of diminution, or
extinction, of any transmitted light; thus, it is the attenuation
coefficient applied to visible radiation. The extinction coefficient is
identified as dI = -I dx or I = I0 e-x where I is the illuminance
(luminous flux density) at the selected point in space, I0 is the
illuminance at the light source; and x is the distance from the source.
When so used, the extinction coefficient equals the sum of the medium's
absorption coefficient and scattering coefficient, each computed as a
weighted average over all wavelengths in the visible spectrum. As long
as scattering effects are primary, as in the lower atmosphere, the value
of the extinction coefficient is a function of the particle size of
atmospheric suspensoids. It varies in order of magnitude from 10 per
kilometer with very low visibility to 0.01 per kilometer in very clear
air.
