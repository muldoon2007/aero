# Definition

In spectrography, a measure of the total absorption of radiant energy as
indicated by an absorption line or absorption band. Compare line width.
The formula for equivalent width W is where A is the fraction of
incident radiation which is absorbed at any wavelength, and 1 and 2 are
wavelengths, on opposite sides of the line or band, where the absorption
has dropped to zero. Thus, in a plot of A against , the equivalent width
represents the area under the curve, or the width of a fictitious line
or band which absorbs completely throughout its extent but which absorbs
the same total amount of energy as the actual line or band.
