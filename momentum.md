# Definition

Quantity of motion. Linear momentum is the quantity obtained by
multiplying the mass of a body by its linear speed. Angular momentum is
the quantity obtained by multiplying the moment of inertia of a body by
its angular speed. The momentum of a system of particles is given by the
sum of the momentums of the individual particles which make up the
system or by the product of the total mass of the system and the
velocity of the center of gravity of the system. The momentum of a
continuous medium is given by the integral of the velocity over the mass
of the medium or by the product of the total mass of the medium and the
velocity of the center of gravity of the medium.
