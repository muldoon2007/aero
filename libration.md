# Definition

A real or apparent oscillatory motion, particularly the apparent
oscillation of the moon. Because of libration more than half of the
moon's surface is revealed to an observer on the earth even through the
same side of the moon is always toward the earth, because the moon's
periods of rotation and revolution are the same. Other motions regarded
as librations are long period orbital motions and periodic perturbation
in orbital elements.
