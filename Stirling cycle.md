# Definition

A theoretical heat engine cycle in which heat is added at constant
volume, followed by isothermal expansion with heat addition. The heat is
then rejected at constant volume, followed by isothermal compression
with heat rejection. If a regenerator is used so that heat rejected
during the constant-volume process is recovered during heat addition at
constant volume, the thermal efficiency of the Stirling cycle is the
same as for the Carnot cycle, with less compressive work needed.
