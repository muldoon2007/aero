# Definition

1.  In meteorology, a short period oscillation of pressure such as that
    associated with the propagation of sound through the atmosphere; a
    type of longitudinal wave. See sound wave, compression wave. These
    waves are usually recorded on sensitive microbarographs capable of
    measuring pressure changes of amounts down to 10E-4 millibar.
    Typical values for the period and wavelength of pressure waves are
    1/2 to 5 seconds and 100 to 1500 meters, respectively. Pressure
    waves produced by explosions in the upper atmosphere are of value in
    determining the high-altitude temperatures and winds. 2. A wave or
    periodicity which exists in the variation of atmospheric pressure on
    any scale, usually excluding normal diurnal and seasonal trends. See
    barometric wave. Such waves can persist for an indefinite length of
    time only if they coincide approximately with the free oscillations
    of the atmosphere. Waves of a period longer than that associated
    with the passage of large-scale weather disturbances are difficult
    to isolate, since they usually have such a small amplitude that they
    can be extracted from the data and only by means of precise
    statistical methods.
