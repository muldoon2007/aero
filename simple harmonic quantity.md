# Definition

A periodic quantity that is a sinusoidal function of the independent
variable. Thus, γ = A sin ( ωx + φ) where y is the simple harmonic
quantity; A is the amplitude; ω is the angular frequency; x is the
independent variable; and φ is the phase of the oscillation. The maximum
value of the simple harmonic quantity is the amplitude A; it is
sometimes called, for emphasis, the single amplitude to distinguish it
from double amplitude which for a simple harmonic quantity is the same
as the total excursion or peak-to-peak value. When a simple harmonic
quantity is expressed as a complex quantity, the term amplitude must be
used with caution in view of possible confusion with the alternate
meaning of amplitude as the angle or argument of a complex quantity.
