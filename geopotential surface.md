# Definition

A surface of constant geopotential, i.e., a surface along which a
particle of matter could move without undergoing any changes in its
potential energy. Also called equigeopotential surface, level surface.
Geopotential surfaces almost coincide with surfaces of constant
geometric height. Because of the poleward increase of the acceleration
of gravity along a constant geometric-height surface, a given
geopotential surface has a small geometric-height over the poles than
over the equator. See potential, geopotential height, dynamic height.
