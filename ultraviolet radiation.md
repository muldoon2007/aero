# Definition

Electromagnetic radiation of shorter wavelength than visible radiation;
roughly, radiation in the wavelength interval from 100 to 4000
angstroms. Also called ultraviolet. See X-ray, note. Ultraviolet
radiation from the sun is responsible for many complex photochemical
reactions characteristic of the upper atmosphere; e.g., the formation of
the ozone layer through ultraviolet dissociation of oxygen molecules
followed by recombination to form ozone.
