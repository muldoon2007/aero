# Definition

Any system of coordinates in which properties of a fluid are assigned to
points in space at each given time, without attempt to identify
individual fluid parcels from one time to the next. See equations of
motion. Compare Lagrangian coordinates. Eulerian coordinates are to be
distinguished from Lagrangian coordinates. The particular coordinate
system used to identify points in space (Cartesian, cylindrical,
spherical, etc.) is quite independent of whether the representation is
Eulerian or Lagrangian.
