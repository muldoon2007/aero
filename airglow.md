# Definition

The quasi-steady radiant emission from the upper atmosphere as
distinguished from the sporadic emission of the auroras. Airglow is a
chemiluminescence due primarily to the emission of the molecules O2 and
N2, the radical OH, and the atoms O and Na. Emissions observed in
airglow could arise from three-body atom collisions forming molecules,
from two-body reactions between atoms and molecules, or from
recombination of ions. Historically, airglow has referred to visual
radiation. Some recent studies use airglow to refer to radiation outside
the visual range.
