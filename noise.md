# Definition

1.  Any undesired sound. By extension, noise is any unwanted disturbance
    within a useful frequency band, such as undesired electric waves in
    a transmission channel or device. When caused by natural electrical
    discharges in the atmosphere, noise may be called static. 2. An
    erratic, intermittent, or statistically random oscillation. 3. In
    electrical circuit analysis, that portion of the unwanted signal
    which is statistically random, as distinguished from hum, which is
    an unwanted signal occurring at multiples of the power-supply
    frequency. If ambiguity exists as to the nature of the noise, a
    phrase such as acoustic noise or electric noise should be used.
    Since the above definition are not mutually exclusive, it is usually
    necessary to depend on context for the distinction. See white noise.
