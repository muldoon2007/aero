An instrument for detecting and measuring radioactivity. In full,
Geiger-Muller counter. This counter, essentially a thin-walled
gas-filled metallic tube with a needle electrode projected within,
detects the radiating particle indirectly. The particle penetrates the
thin wall and ionizes the gas; a current is momentarily set up, which is
detectable and measurable. Compare [[scintillation counter]] .
