# Definition

The (dimensionless) ratio of the actual vapor pressure of the air to the
saturation vapor pressure. The corresponding ratios of specific humidity
or of mixing ratio give approximations of sufficient accuracy for many
purposes in meteorology. The relative humidity is usually express in
percent. Also called humidity. See absolute humidity, dew point. The
ratio of mixing ratio to saturation mixing ratio is preferred as a
definition of relative humidity by the International Meteorological
Organization.
