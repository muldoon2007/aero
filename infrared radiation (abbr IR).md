# Definition

Electromagnetic radiation lying in the wavelength interval from about 75
microns to an indefinite upper boundary sometimes arbitrarily set at
1000 microns (0.01 centimeter). Also called long-wave radiation. At the
lower limit of this interval, the infrared radiation spectrum is bounded
by visible radiation, whereas on its upper limit it is bounded by
microwave radiation of the type important in radar technology. See
electromagnetic spectrum. Whereas visible radiation is generated
primarily by intra-atomic processes, infrared radiation is generated
almost wholly by larger scale intramolecular processes, chiefly
molecular rotations and internal vibrations of many types. Electrically
symmetric molecules, such as the nitrogen and oxygen molecules which
comprise most of the earth's atmosphere, are not capable of absorbing or
emitting infrared radiation, but several of the triatomic gases, such as
water vapor, carbon dioxide, and ozone, are infrared active and play
important roles in the propagation of infrared radiation in the
atmosphere. Since a black body at terrestrial temperature radiates with
maximum intensity in the infrared spectrum (near 10 microns), there
exist a complex system of infrared radiation currents within the earth's
atmosphere.
