# Definition

The conditions of temperature gradient, thermal conductivity, and
viscosity which lead to the onset of convection in a fluid. Such gross
phenomena as atmospheric winds are an example of this type of
instability. In general, if the fluid is conducting, as a plasma, the
applications of a magnetic field tends to reduce these thermal
instabilities.
