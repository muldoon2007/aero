# Definition

The vorticity equation in the absence of horizontal divergence and
vertical motion, so that the absolute vorticity of a parcel is
conserved: where is the relative vorticity and f is the coriolis
parameter. This equation may also be interpreted as governing vertically
averaged flow in which divergence is present but wind direction is
constant with height. See equivalent barotropic model.
