# Definition

The process in which the direction of energy propagation is changed as
the result of a change in density within the propagating medium, or as
the energy passes through the interface representing a density
discontinuity between two media. In the first instance the rays undergo
a smooth bending over a finite distance. In the second case the index of
refraction changes through an interfacial layer that is thin compared to
the wavelength of the radiation; thus, the refraction is abrupt,
essentially discontinuous. See atmospheric refraction. Compare
reflection, diffraction, scattering.
