# Definition

1.  Of metals, properties whose magnitude varies depending on the
    relation of the test axis to a specific direction within the metal.
    The variation results from preferred orientation or from fibering of
    constituents or inclusions. 2. For thermal radiation properties, in
    a specified direction from the surface, usually measured as the
    angle from the normal.
