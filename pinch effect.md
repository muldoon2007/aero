# Definition

1.  The result of an electromechanical force that constricts, and
    sometimes momentarily ruptures, a molten conductor carrying current
    at high density. 2. The self-contraction of a plasma column carrying
    large currents due to the interaction of this current with its own
    magnetic field. The current required for such an effect is the order
    of 10E5 amperes. If the current is pulsed on for a short time, a
    radially imploding shock wave is generated.
