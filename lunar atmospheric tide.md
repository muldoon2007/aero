# Definition

An atmospheric tide due to the gravitational attraction of the moon. The
only detectable components are the 12-lunar-hour or semidiurnal, as in
the oceanic tides, and two others of very nearly the same period. The
amplitude of this atmospheric tide is so small that it is detected only
by careful statistical analysis of a long record, being about 0.06
millibar in the tropics and 0.02 millibar in the middle latitudes. See
tide.
