# Definition

A condensation trail that forms when the water vapor of an aircraft
exhaust is mixed with and saturates (or slightly supersaturates) the air
in the wake of the aircraft. Exhaust trails are of more common
occurrence and of longer duration than aerodynamic trails. Also called
engine-exhaust trail.
