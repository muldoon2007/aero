# Definition

The array of absorption lines and absorption bands which results from
the passage of radiant energy from a continuous source through a
selectively absorbing medium cooler than the source. See electromagnetic
spectrum. The absorption spectrum is a characteristic of the absorbing
medium, just as an emission spectrum is a characteristic of a radiator.
An absorption spectrum formed by a monatomic gas exhibits discrete dark
lines, whereas that formed by a polyatomic gas exhibits ordered arrays
(bands) of dark lines, which appear to overlap. This type of absorption
is often referred to as line absorption. The spectrum formed by a
selectively absorbing liquid or solid is typically continuous in nature
(continuous absorption).
