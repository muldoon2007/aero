# Definition

The assembled structural and aerodynamic components of an aircraft or
rocket vehicle that support the different systems and subsystems
integral to the video. The word airframe, a carryover from aviation
usage, remains appropriate for rocket vehicles since a major function of
the airframe is performed during flight within the atmosphere. There is
disagreement as to whether the nose cone and combustion chambers are
included in the term airframe while they are attached to the vehicle.
