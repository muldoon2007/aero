A coordinate system in which the locations of points in space are
expressed by reference to three planes, called coordinate planes, no two
of which are parallel. Compare [[curvilinear coordinates]] . The three planes
intersect in three straight lines, called coordinate axes. The
coordinate planes and coordinate axes intersect in a common point,
called the origin. From any point P in space three straight lines may be
drawn, each of which is parallel to one of the three coordinate planes.
If A, B, C denote these points of intersection, the Cartesian
coordinates of P are the distances PA, PB, and PC. If the coordinate
axes are mutually perpendicular, the coordinate system is rectangular;
otherwise, oblique.
