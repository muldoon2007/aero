A coordinate system in which the locations of points in space are
expressed by reference to three planes, called coordinate planes, no two
of which are parallel. Compare curvilinear coordinates. The three planes
intersect in three straight lines, called coordinate axes. The
coordinate planes and coordinate axes intersect in a common point,
called the origin. From any point P in space three straight lines may be
drawn, each of which is parallel to one of the three coordinate planes.
If A, B, C denote these points of intersection, the Cartesian
coordinates of P are the distances PA, PB, and PC. If the coordinate
axes are mutually perpendicular, the coordinate system is rectangular;
otherwise, oblique.
