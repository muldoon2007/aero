1.  The formation or liberation of gases in the blood vessels of the
    body, as brought on by a too-rapid change from a high, or relatively
    high, atmospheric pressure to a lower one. 2. The disease or
    condition caused by the formation of gas bubbles (mostly nitrogen)
    in the body fluids. The disease is characterized principally by
