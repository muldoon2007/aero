# Definition

A method of ignition of a liquid-propellant rocket engine in which a
liquid which is hypergolic with either the fuel or the oxidizer is
injected into the combustion chamber to initiate combustion. Aniline is
used as an auxiliary fluid with nitric acid and some organic fuels to
initiate combustion.
