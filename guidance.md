# Definition

The process of directing the movements of an aeronautical vehicle or
space vehicle, with particular reference to the selection of a flight
path. See control. In preset guidance a predetermined path is set into
the guidance mechanism and not altered, in inertial guidance
accelerations are measured and integrated within the craft, in command
guidance the craft responds to information received from an outside
source. Beam-rider guidance utilizes a beam; terrestrial-reference
guidance, some influence of the earth; celestial guidance, the celestial
bodies and particularly the stars; and homing guidance the information
is in response to transmissions from the craft, in semiactive homing
guidance the transmissions are from a source other than the craft, and
in passive homing guidance natural radiations from the destination are
utilized. Midcourse guidance extends from the end of the launching phase
to an arbitrary point enroute and terminal guidance extends from this
point to the destination.
