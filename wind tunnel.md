# Definition

A tubelike structure or passage, sometimes continuous, together with its
adjuncts, in which a high-speed movement of air or other gas is
produced, as by a fan, and within which objects such as engines or
aircraft, airfoils, rockets (or models of these objects), etc., are
placed to investigate the airflow about them and the aerodynamic forces
acting upon them. Tunnels are designated by the means used to produce
the gas flow, as hot shot tunnel, arc tunnel, blow down tunnel; by the
speed range, as supersonic tunnel, hypersonic tunnel; or by the medium
used, as plasma tunnel, light gas tunnel.
