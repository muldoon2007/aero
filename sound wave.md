# Definition

A mechanical disturbance advancing with infinite velocity through an
elastic medium and consisting of longitudinal displacements of the
medium, i.e., consisting of compressional and rarefactional
displacements parallel to the direction of advance of the disturbance; a
longitudinal wave. Sound waves are small-amplitude adiabatic
oscillations. The wave equation governing the motion of sound waves has
the form 2 = (1/c2)(2/t2) where 2 is the Laplace operator, is the
velocity potential, c is the speed of sound, and t is the time; the
density variations and velocities are small. As so defined, this
includes waves outside the frequency limits of human hearing, which
limits customarily define sound. Also called acoustic wave, sonic wave.
See ultrasonic, infrasonic, pressure wave. Gases, liquids, and solids
transmit sound waves, and the propagation velocity is characteristic of
the nature and physical state of each of these media. In those cases
where a steadily vibrating sound generator acts as a source of waves,
one may speak of a uniform wave train; but in other cases (explosions,
lightning discharges) a violent initial disturbance sends out a
principal wave, followed by waves of more or less rapidly diminishing
amplitude.
