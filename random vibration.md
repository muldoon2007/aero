# Definition

An oscillation whose instantaneous magnitude is not specified for any
given instant of time. The instantaneous magnitudes of a random
oscillation are specified only by probability distribution functions
giving the fraction of the total time that the magnitude, or some
sequence of magnitudes, lies within a specified range. A random
vibration whose instantaneous magnitudes occur according to the Gaussian
distribution is called Gaussian random vibration. Wide-band vibration
amplitude is usually expressed as root-mean-square acceleration in
gravitational units of acceleration g. The parameter used to specify the
frequency distribution of a random vibration is power spectral density
(g2 per cycle per second), sometimes called acceleration density or
acceleration spectral density.
