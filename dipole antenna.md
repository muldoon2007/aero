# Definition

A straight radiator, usually fed in the center, and producing a maximum
of radiation in the plane normal to its axis. The length specified is
the overall length. Common usage in microwave antennas considers a
dipole to be a metal radiating structure which supports a line current
distribution similar to that of a thin straight wire, a half wavelength
long, so energized that the current has two nodes, one at each of the
far ends.
