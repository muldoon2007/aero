# Definition

The rate at which solar radiation is received outside the earth's
atmosphere on a surface normal to the incident radiation and at the
earth's mean distance from the sun. Measurements of solar radiation at
the earth's surface by the Smithsonian Institution for several decades
give a best value for the solar constant of 1.934 calories per square
centimeter per minute. Measurements from rockets of the intensity of the
ultraviolet end of the spectrum have corrected this value to 2.00
calories per square centimeter per minute with a probable error of +/- 2
percent.
