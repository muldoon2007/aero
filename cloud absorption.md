# Definition

The absorption of electromagnetic radiation by the water drops and water
vapor within a cloud. Compare cloud attenuation. For insolation
(incoming solar radiation), clouds absorb rather small fractions,
particularly of the shorter wavelengths. Even for depths of clouds of
the order of 20,000 feet, measurements suggest absorptions of less than
30 percent, while layers only 1000 to 2000 feet thick may absorb only
about 5 percent. However, for long wave terrestrial radiation, even very
thin layers of cloud act as almost complete black-body absorbers.
