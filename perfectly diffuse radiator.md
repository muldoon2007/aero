# Definition

A body that emits radiant energy in accordance with Lambert law. The
radiant intensity emitted in any direction from a unit area of such a
radiator varies as the cosine of the angle between the normal to the
surface and the direction of the radiation. Compare diffuse radiation,
isotropic radiator. When viewed from a distance, an incandescent
perfectly diffuse radiator appears as a uniformly illuminated flat
surface regardless of its actual shape or orientation.
