# Definition

The total thrust of a jet engine without deduction of the drag due to
the momentum of the incoming air (ram drag). The gross thrust is equal
to the product of the mass rate of fluid flow and the velocity of the
fluid relative to the nozzle, plus the product of the nozzle exit area
and the difference between the exhaust pressure and ambient pressure.
