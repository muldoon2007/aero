# Definition

The physical process by which a liquid or solid is transformed to the
gaseous state; the opposite of condensation. Also called vaporization.
In meteorology, evaporation usually is restricted in use to the change
of water from liquid to gas, while sublimation is used for the change
from solid to gas as well as from gas to solid. According to the kinetic
theory of gases, evaporation occurs when liquid molecules escape into
the vapor phase as a result of the chance acquisition of above average,
outward-directed, translational velocities at a time when they happen to
lie within about one mean free path below the effective liquid surface.
It is conventionally stated that evaporation into a gas ceases when the
gas reaches saturation. In reality, net evaporation does cease, but only
because the numbers of molecules escaping from and returning to the
liquid are equal, that is, evaporation is counteracted by condensation.
Energy is lost by an evaporating liquid; and, when no heat is added
externally, the liquid always cools. The heat thus removed is termed the
latent heat of vaporization.
