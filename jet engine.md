# Definition

1.  Broadly, and engine that ejects a jet or stream of gas or fluid,
    obtaining all or most of its thrust by reaction to the ejection. See
    reaction engine. 2. Specifically, an aircraft engine that derives
    all or most of its thrust by reaction to its ejection of combustion
    products (or heated air) in a jet and that obtains oxygen from the
    atmosphere for the combustion of its fuel (or outside air for
    heating, as in the case of the nuclear jet engine), distinguished in
    this sense from a rocket engine. A jet engine of this kind may have
    a compressor, commonly turbine-driven, to take in and compress air
    (turbojet), or it may be compressorless, taking in and compressing
    air by other means ( pulsejet, ramjet).
