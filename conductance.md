# Definition

1.  In electricity, the ratio of the current flowing through an electric
    circuit to the difference of potential between the ends of the
    circuit, the reciprocal of resistance. See conductivity. 2. In
    vacuum systems, the throughput Q under steady-state conservative
    conditions divided by the measured difference in pressure p between
    two specified cross sections inside a pumping system: G = Q/(p1-p2).
