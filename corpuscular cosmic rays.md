# Definition

Primary cosmic rays from outer space which consist mainly of protons
with energies of 2-20 billion electron volts (Bev). For 1000 protons
there are about 80 helium nuclei, about 3 nuclei in the
carbon-nitrogen-oxygen range, and 1 or 2 heavier nuclei. The proton
energy may be as high as 105 Bev, and the other nuclei show an energy
distribution similar to that of the protons.
