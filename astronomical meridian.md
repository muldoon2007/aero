# Definition

A line connecting points having the same astronomical longitude. Also
called terrestrial meridian . Because the deflection of the vertical
varies from point to point, the astronomical meridian is an irregular
line. When the astronomical meridian is corrected for station error, it
becomes the geodetic meridian.
