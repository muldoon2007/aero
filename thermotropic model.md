# Definition

A model atmosphere used in numerical forecasting in which the parameters
to be forecast are the height of one constant-pressure surface (usually
500 millibars) and one temperature (usually the mean temperature between
1000 and 500 millibars). Thus, a surface prognostic chart can also be
constructed. The quasi-geostrophic approximation is employed and the
thermal wind is assumed constant with height. See equivalent barotropic
model.
