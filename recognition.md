# Definition

The psychological process in which an observer so interprets the visual
stimuli he receives from a distant object that he forms a correct
conclusion as to the exact nature of the object. Recognition is a more
subtle phenomenon than the antecedent step of detection, for the latter
involves only the simpler process of interpreting visual stimuli to the
extend of concluding that an object is present at some distance from the
observer.
