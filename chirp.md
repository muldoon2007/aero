# Definition

An all-encompassing term for the various techniques of pulse
expansion-pulse compression applied to pulse radar; a technique to
expand narrow pulses to wide pulses for transmission, and compress wide
received pulses to the original narrow pulse width and wave shape, to
gain improvement in signal-to-noise ratio without degradation to range
resolution and range discrimination.
