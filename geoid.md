# Definition

The figure of the earth as defined by the geopotential surface which
most nearly coincides with mean sea level over the entire surface of the
earth. Because of variations in the direction of gravity, to which it is
everywhere perpendicular, the geoid is not quite an ellipsoid of
revolution, the sea-level surface being higher under mountainous areas.
Compare equilibrium spheroid, geosphere.
