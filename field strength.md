# Definition

1.  For any physical field, the flux density, intensity, or gradient of
    the field at the point in question. Also called field intensity.
    Although field intensity is commonly used, it should be noted that
    this does not follow the strict radiometric definition of intensity,
    i.e., flux per unit solid angle. 2. = signal strength, in radar. 3.
    = electric field strength.
