# Definition

The whole number nearest the value of the atomic mass of an element as
expressed in atomic mass units. The mass number is assumed to represent
the total number of protons and neutrons in the atomic nucleus of the
element and is therefore equal to the atomic number plus the number of
the neutrons. The mass number of an atom is usually written as a
superscript to the element symbol, as in O18, an isotope of oxygen with
mass number 18.
