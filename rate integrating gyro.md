# Definition

A single-degree-of-freedom gyro having primarily viscous restraint of
its spin axis about the output axis. In this gyro an output signal is
produced by gimbal angular displacement, relative to the base, which is
proportional to the integral of the angular rate of the base about the
input axis.
