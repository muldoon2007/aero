# Definition

The period of one revolution of the earth around the sun, with respect
to the vernal equinox. Because of precession of the equinoxes, the
tropical year is not 360 degrees with respect to the stars, but 50
minutes 0.3 seconds less. A tropical year is about 20 minutes shorter
than a sidereal year, averaging 365 days 5 hours 48 minutes 45.68
seconds in 1955 and is increasing at the rate of 0.005305 second
annually. Also called astronomical, equinoctial, natural, or solar year.
