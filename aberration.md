# Definition

1.  In astronomy, the apparent angular displacement of the position of a
    celestial body in the direction of motion of the observer, caused by
    the combination of the velocity of the observer and the velocity of
    light. See constant of aberration, planetary aberration. Compare
    parallax. 2. In optics, a specific deviation from perfect imagery,
    as, for example: spherical aberration, coma, astigmatism, curvature
    of field, and distortion.
