# Definition

1.  Control exercised over an extensive and complicated system from a
    single center. 2. Usually capitalized. The place, facility, or
    activity from which this control is exercised; specifically, at Cape
    Canaveral or at Vandenberg AFB, the place, facility, or activity at
    which the whole action incident to a test launch and flight is
    coordinated and controlled, from the make-ready at the launch site
    and on the range, to the end of the rocket flight downrange. For a
    few seconds during the actual launch, control of a missile is
    exercised from the blockhouse, but it almost immediately reverts to
    Central Control for guidance and tracking, with two men in essential
    control. One of these is the supervisor of range operations, the
    other is the range safety officer.
