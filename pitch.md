# Definition

1.  Of a vehicle, an angular displacement about an axis parallel to the
    lateral axis of the vehicle. 2. In acoustics, that attribute of
    auditory sensation in terms of which sounds may be ordered on a
    scale extending from low to high. Pitch depends primarily upon the
    frequency of the sound stimulus, but it also depends upon the sound
    pressure and waveform of the stimulus. The pitch of a sound may be
    described by the frequency or frequency level of that simple tone
    having a specified sound pressure level which is judged by listeners
    to produce the same pitch.
