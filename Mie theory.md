# Definition

A complete mathematical-physical theory of the scattering of
electromagnetic radiation by spherical particles, developed by G. Mie in
1908. In contrast to Rayleigh scattering, the Mie theory embraces all
possible ratios of diameter to wavelength. The Mie theory is very
important in meteorological optics, where diameter-to-wavelength ratios
of the order of unity and larger are characteristic of many problems
regarding haze and cloud scattering. Scattering of radar energy by
raindrops constitutes another significant application of the Mie theory.
