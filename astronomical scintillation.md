# Definition

Any scintillation phenomena, such as irregular oscillatory motion,
variation of intensity, and color fluctuation observed in the light
emanating from am extraterrestrial source; to be distinguished from
terrestrial scintillation primarily in that the light source for the
latter lies somewhere within the earth's atmosphere. Also called stellar
scintillation . See seeing. Astronomical scintillation is typically
strongest for celestial objects lying at large zenith distances and is
not easily observed by eye for objects whose zenith distances are under
30Â°. Nonperiodic vibratory motions of stellar images with frequencies of
the order of 1 to 10 cycles per second create a troublesome problem of
seeing in astronomical work. The size of the schlieren producing
vibratory scintillations has been estimated to be of the order of
centimeters, and chromatic scintillations of celestial objects appear to
be produced by parcels whose dimensions are of the order of decimeters
or, perhaps, meters. Hence, astronomical scintillation is primarily a
consequence of the high-frequency, short-wavelength type of atmospheric
turbulence.
