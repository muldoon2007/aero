# Definition

A nondimensional number arising in problems of a rotating viscous fluid.
Also called rotation Reynolds number. It may appear either as Ωh2/v in
which case it equals one-half the square root of the Taylor number, or
as Ωr2/v where r is a suitable radius, h is a representative depth,
&Omega is the absolute angular speed, and v is the kinematic viscosity.
