# Definition

(abbr GSE) That equipment on the ground, including all implements,
tools, and devices (mobile or fixed), required to inspect, test, adjust,
calibrate, appraise, gage, measure, repair, overhaul, assemble,
disassemble, transport, safeguard, record, store, or otherwise function
in support of a rocket, space vehicle, or the like, either in the
research and development phase or in an operational phase, or in support
of the guidance system used with the missile, vehicle, or the like. The
GSE is not considered to include land or buildings; nor does it include
the guidance-station equipment itself, but it does include the test and
checkout equipment required for operation of the guidance-station
equipment.
