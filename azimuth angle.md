# Definition

1.  Azimuth measured from 0° at the north or south reference direction
    clockwise or counterclockwise through 90° or 180°. Azimuth angle is
    labeled with the reference direction as a prefix and the direction
    of measurement from the reference direction as a suffix. Thus,
    azimuth angle S 144° W is 144° west of south, or azimuth 324°. When
    azimuth angle is measured through 180°, it is labeled N or S to
    agree with the latitude and E or W to agree with the meridian
    angle. 2. In surveying, an angle in triangulation or in traverse
    through which the computation of azimuth is carried.
