# Definition

1.  A cathode-ray indicator in which a signal appears on a radial line.
    Distance is indicated radially and bearing as an angle. 2. In radar
    technique, a cathode-ray indicator on which blips produced by
    signals from reflecting objects and transponders are shown in plan
    position, thus forming a maplike display. Also called P-indicator,
    P-scan, P-scope. A north-upward plan position indicator has north at
    the top of the indicator regardless of the heading; a heading-upward
    plan position indicator has the heading of the craft maintained at
    the top of the indicator. On a delayed plan position indicator the
    start of the sweep is delayed so that the center represents a
    selected range. This allows distant targets to be displayed on a
    short range scale, thus providing larger scale presentation. An
    open-center plan position indicator has no signal displayed within a
    set distance from the center. An off-center plan position indicator
    is one modified so that the center about which the trace rotates can
    be moved from the center of the screen to provide a larger scale for
    distant targets. A master plan position indicator controls remote
    indicators or repeaters.
