# Definition

The radiation from a charged particle whose velocity is greater than the
phase velocity that an electromagnetic wave would have if it were
propagating in the medium. The particle will continue to lose energy by
radiation until its velocity is less than this phase velocity. This
phenomenon is analogous to the generation of a shock wave when an object
is traveling faster than the sound velocity of the medium. A bow wave is
set up which radiates energy into the medium and slows down the object.
The angle that the cone of luminescence makes with the direction of
motion of the particle can be used to measure the velocity of the
particle.
