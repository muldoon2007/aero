# Definition

Defined in analogy to the oceanic tide as an atmospheric motion on a
worldwide scale, in which vertical accelerations are neglected (but
compressibility is taken into account). Also called atmospheric
oscillation . Both the sun and moon produce atmospheric tides; and there
exist both gravitational tides and thermal tides. The harmonic component
of greatest amplitude, the 12-hour or semidiurnal solar atmospheric
tide, is both gravitational and thermal in origin, the fact that it is
greater than the corresponding lunar atmospheric tide being ascribed
usually to a resonance in the atmosphere with a free period very close
to the tidal period. Other tides of 6, 8, and 24 hours have been
observed.
