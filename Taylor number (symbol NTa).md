# Definition

A nondimensional number arising in problems of a rotating viscous fluid.
It may be written NTa = f2h4/v2 where f is the coriolis parameter (or,
for a cylindrical system, twice the rate of rotation of the system); h
represents the depth of the fluid; and v is the kinematic viscosity. the
square root of the Taylor number is a rotating Reynolds number, and the
fourth root is proportional to the ratio of the depth h to the depth of
the Ekman layer.
