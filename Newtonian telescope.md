# Definition

A reflecting telescope in which a small plane mirror reflects the
convergent beam from the objective to an eyepiece at one side of the
telescope. After the second reflection the rays travel approximately
perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the telescope. See Cassegrain
telescope.
