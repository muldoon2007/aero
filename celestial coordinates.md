# Definition

Any set of coordinates used to define a point on the celestial sphere.
The horizon, celestial equator, ecliptic, and galactic systems of
celestial coordinates are based on the celestial horizon, celestial
equator, ecliptic, and galactic equator, respectively, as the primary
great circle. See coordinate, Table VI, for a comparison of the systems.
