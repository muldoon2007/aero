# Definition

For a given substance, the ratio of the capacity of a condenser with
that substance as dielectric to the capacity of the same condenser with
a vacuum for dielectric. It is a measure, therefore, of the amount of
electrical charge a given substance can withstand at a given electric
field strength; it should not be confused with dielectric strength. The
dielectric constant is a function of temperature and frequency and is
written as a complex quantity where ' is the part that determines the
displacement current and '' the dielectric absorption (see dielectric).
For a nonabsorbing, nonmagnetic material ' is equal to the square of the
index of refraction and the relation holds only at the particular
frequency where these conditions apply.
