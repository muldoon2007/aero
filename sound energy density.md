# Definition

At a point in a sound field, the sound energy contained in a given
infinitesimal part of the medium divided by the volume of that part of
the medium. The terms instantaneous energy density, maximum energy
density, and peak energy density have meanings analogous to the related
terms used for sound pressure. In speaking of average energy density in
general, it is necessary to distinguish between the space average (at a
given instant) and the time average (at a given point).
