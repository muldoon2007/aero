# Definition

That magnetoionic wave component deviating the least, in most of its
propagation characteristics, relative to those expected for a wave in
the absence of the earth's magnetic field. More exactly, if at fixed
electron density, the direction of the earth's magnetic field were
rotated until its direction is transverse to the direction of phase
propagation, the wave component whose propagation is then independent of
the magnitude of the earth's magnetic field. Also called ordinary-wave
component. See magnetic double refraction, magnetoionic theory.
