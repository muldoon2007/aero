# Definition

In general, the mean distance between maximums (or minimums) of a
roughly periodic pattern. Specifically, the least distance between
particles moving in the same phase of oscillation in a wave disturbance.
The wavelength is measured along the direction of propagation of the
wave, usually from the midpoint of a crest (or trough) to the midpoint
of the next adjoining crest (or trough). It is related to frequency f
and phase speed v by λ = v / f , where λ is wavelength. The reciprocal
of wavelength is the wave number.
