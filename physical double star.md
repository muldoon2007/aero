# Definition

Two stars in nearly the same line of sight and at approximately the same
distance from the observer, as distinguished from an optical double star
(two stars in nearly the same line of sight but differing greatly in
distance from the observer). If the stars revolve about their common
center of mass, they are called a binary star.
