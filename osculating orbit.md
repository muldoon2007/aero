# Definition

The ellipse that a satellite would follow after a specific time t (the
epoch of osculation) if all forces other than central inverse-square
forces ceased to act from time t on. An osculating orbit is tangent to
the real, perturbed, orbit and has the same velocity at the point of
tangency.
