# Definition

The circular motion of a charged particle in a uniform magnetic field.
Whereas the motion of the particle is unimpeded along the magnetic
field, motion perpendicular to the field is always accompanied by a
force perpendicular to the direction of motion and the field. The
electron or ion will orbit in a plane perpendicular to the magnetic
field. By adding any arbitrary velocity along the magnetic field, the
total path looks like a helix. The size of the Larmor orbit or helix is
proportional to the particle velocity divided by the magnetic field. In
a 1-gauss field, a 1-volt electron has an orbit of about 3 centimeters,
and a 1-volt proton an orbit of about 1 meter.
