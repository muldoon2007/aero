# Definition

1.  A step-by-step process that culminates in a climactic event, each
    step being performed in accordance with a schedule marked by a count
    in inverse numerical order; specifically, this process is used in
    leading up to the launch of a large or complicated rocket vehicle,
    or in leading up to a captive test, a readiness firing, a mock
    firing, or other firing test. 2. The act of counting inversely
    during this process. In sense 2, the countdown ends with T-time;
    thus, T minus 60 minutes indicates there are 60 minutes to go,
    excepting for holds and recycling. The countdown may by hours,
    minutes, or seconds. At the end, it narrows down to seconds,
    4-3-2-1-0. See plus count.
