# Definition

1.  A device which utilizes the angular momentum of a spinning mass
    (rotor) to sense angular motion of its base about one or two axes
    orthogonal to the spin axis. Also called gyroscope. This definition
    does not include more complex systems such as stable platforms using
    gyros as components. 2. Short for directional gyro, gyrocompass ,
    etc.
