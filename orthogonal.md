# Definition

Originally, at right angles; later generalized to mean the vanishing of
a sum (or integral) of products. The cosine of the angle between two
vectors V1 and V2 with the respective components x1, y1, z1, and x2, y2,
z2 is proportional to the sum of products x1x2 + y1y1 + z1z2. Hence, if
the vectors are perpendicular, the latter sum equals zero. For this
reason any two series of numbers (x1, x2, … xn) and (y1, y2, …yn) is
said to be orthogonal if Σ xiyi = 0
