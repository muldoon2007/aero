# Definition

1.  The algebraic difference between an index of refraction and unity.
    For the atmosphere, refractivity may be more conveniently expressed
    in N-units: N = (n - 1) 10E6 The deviation of the refractivity at
    any altitude from the usual standard profile is expressed in B-units
    (for radiofrequencies up to 20 kilomegacycles): B = N + 0.12h where
    h is altitude in feet. The deviation of the refractivity at any
    altitude from the gradient at which the refraction curvature of a
    tangential ray will match the curvature of the earth may be
    expressed in M- units: M = N + 0.048h where 0.048 is 10E6 divided by
    the radius of the earth in feet. 2. = index of refraction. This
    usage should be discouraged.
