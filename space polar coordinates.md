# Definition

A system of coordinates by which a point on the surface of a sphere is
located in three dimensions by (a) its distance from a fixed point at
the center, called the pole; (b) the colatitude or angle between the
polar axis (a reference line through the pole) and the radius vector (a
straight line connecting the pole and the point); and (c) the longitude
or angle between a reference plane through the polar axis and a plane
through the radius vector and polar axis. See polar coordinates,
spherical coordinates, cylindrical coordinates.
