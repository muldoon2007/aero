# Definition

A graphical representation of the radiation of an antenna as a function
of direction. Cross sections in which radiation patterns are frequently
given are vertical planes and the horizontal plane, or the principal
electric and magnetic polarization planes. Also called antenna pattern,
lobe pattern, coverage diagram. Two types of radiation patterns should
be distinguished. They are: (a) the free-space radiation pattern which
is the complete lobe pattern of the antenna and is a function of the
wavelength, feed system, and reflector characteristics, and (b) the
field radiation pattern which differs primarily from the free-space
pattern by the formation of interference lobes whenever direct and
reflected wave trains interfere with each other as is found in most
surface-based radars. The envelope of these interference lobes has the
same shape, but, for a perfectly reflecting surface, it has up to twice
the amplitude of the free-space radiation pattern.
