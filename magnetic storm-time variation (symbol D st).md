# Definition

A nonperiodic variation determined from the onset of a magnetic storm.
This variation is characterized by a rapid increase of the magnetic
horizontal intensity above the normal value, remaining so for a few
hours and then rapidly decreasing to below the normal value and
remaining so for periods up to several days. The intensity then returns
slowly to the normal value.
