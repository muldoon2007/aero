# Definition

A measure of the strength of a magnetic field existing within a magnetic
medium. The relation between the magnetic induction and magnetic field
intensity is such that the magnetic induction within a small mass of
material of magnetic permeability � is, except for possible hysteresis
effects, � times greater than the external magnetic field intenstiy.
Whereas magnetic field intensity is measured in oersteds, magnetic
induction is measured in gausses.
