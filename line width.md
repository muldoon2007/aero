# Definition

The finite width, expressed either in wavelength units or frequency
units, of a spectral line (e.g., an absorption line). It is customary to
employ, as a convenient measure of this quantity, the half-width, which
is the width of the spectral line measured between the two points at
which its intensity is just half the peak intensity of the line center.
The bell-shaped profile of a spectral line is produced, in general, by
the joint action of several factors. Each line is characterized, first
of all, by a natural width which is related through quantum principles
to the lifetime of the excited state of the emitting atom or molecule,
in the case of lines in an emission spectrum. This natural width may be
extended by Doppler broadening due to random thermal motions of the
emitting or absorbing gas, by pressure broadening due to collisions
between the particles involved in the radiation, and by electric fields,
as in the Stark effect. Compare equivalent width.
