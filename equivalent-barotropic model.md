# Definition

A model atmosphere characterized by (a) frictionless and adiabatic flow
(b) hydrostatic and quasigeostrophic equilibrium, and in which (c) the
vertical shear of the horizontal wind is assumed to be proportional to
the horizontal wind itself. An equivalent-barotropic atmosphere is,
accordingly, an atmosphere in which the wind does not change direction
with height and consequently one in which the contours and isotherms (on
isobaric surfaces, for example) are everywhere parallel. In such an
atmosphere, the vertically averaged motions are presumably equivalent to
those at some intermediate level, the equivalent-barotropic level. In
terms of the motion at this level, assumed to be an isobaric surface,
the behavior of the equivalent-barotropic model may be described by a
single equation (the vorticity equation) in a single unknown (the height
of the isobaric surface). See barotropic vorticity equation.
