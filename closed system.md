# Definition

1.  In thermodynamics, a system so chosen that no transfer of mass takes
    place across its boundaries; for example, a fluid parcel undergoing
    a saturation-adiabatic process, as opposed to a pseudoadiabatic
    expansion. See open system. 2. In mathematics, a system of
    differential equations and supplementary conditions such that the
    values of all the unknowns (dependent variables) of the system are
    mathematically determined for all values of the independent
    variables (usually space and time) to which the system applies. 3. =
    closed ecological system. 4. A system which constitutes a feedback
    loop so that the inputs and controls depend on the resulting output.
    For example, an automatic radar-controlled tracking system.
