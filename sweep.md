# Definition

The motion of the visible dot across the face of a cathode-ray tube, as
a result of deflections of the electron beam. A linear time-base sweep
has a constant sweep speed before retrace. An expanded time-base sweep
is produced if the sweep speeds is increased during a selected part of
the cycle; a delayed time-base sweep if the start of the sweep is
delayed, usually to provide an expanded scale for a particular part. A
sweep intended primarily for measurement of range may be called a range
sweep. See trace.
