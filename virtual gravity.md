# Definition

The force of gravity on an atmospheric parcel, reduced by centrifugal
force due to the motion of the parcel relative to the earth. The virtual
gravity g\* is g\* = g = V2/a - 2ΩnV , where g is the magnitude of the
acceleration of gravity; V is the parcel speed; a is the earth's radius;
and Ωn is the component of the earth's angular velocity vector normal to
the motion of the parcel. For reasonable atmospheric values, the
correction terms are of the order of 0.01 percent of the magnitude of
gravity. The identity of g\* and g is implied by the assumption of
hydrostatic equilibrium.
