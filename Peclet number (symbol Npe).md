# Definition

A nondimensional number arising in problems of heat transfer in fluids.
It is the ratio of heat advection to heat diffusion and may be written
Npe = U l/k where U is a characteristic velocity; l is a characteristic
length; and k is the thermometric conductivity. Also, Npe = NReNPr where
NRe is the Reynolds number and NPr is the Prandtl number.
