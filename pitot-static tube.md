# Definition

A device consisting essentially of a unit combination of a pitot tube
and a static tube arranged coaxially or otherwise parallel to one
another, used principally in measuring impact and static pressures; also
called pitot-static head. The difference between impact and static
pressure is used to measure the velocity of flow past the tube by means
of a differential-pressure gage. The static pressure from a pitot-static
tube may, in addition, be used in the operation of an altimeter and
similar instruments.
