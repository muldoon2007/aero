# Definition

The state of a plasma where all the neutral particles have lost at least
one electron. In the case of hydrogen atoms which have only one
electron, no further ionization or excitation is possible when the
plasma is fully ionized. For helium and all the heavier gas atoms, there
are many bound electrons, each succeeding one requiring more energy to
be stripped away from its atom. Therefore, in a fully ionized plasma of
these gases, the ions can be further excited and multiply in an ionized
state.
