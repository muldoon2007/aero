# Definition

A thermometer for high-temperature flowing gases that uses a
liquid-cooled tube inserted in the flowing gas; gas temperature is
deduced from the law of convective heat transfer to the outside of the
tube and from measurement of the mass flow rate and temperature rise of
the cooling liquid.
