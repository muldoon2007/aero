# Definition

In radiometry, a measure of the intrinsic radiant intensity emitted by a
radiator in a given direction. It is the irradiance (radiant flux
density) produced by radiation from the source upon a unit surface area
oriented normal to the line between source and receiver, divided by the
solid angle subtended by the source at the receiving surface. It is
assumed that the medium between the radiator and receiver is perfectly
transparent; therefore, radiance is independent of attenuation between
source and receiver. If the radiant source is a perfectly diffuse
radiator (that is, emits exactly according to Lambert law), then its
radiance is equal to its emittance per unit solid angle. The radiance of
a light source is termed luminance (formerly, brightness).
