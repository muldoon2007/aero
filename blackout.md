# Definition

1.  A fadeout of radio communications due to ionospheric disturbances.
    Blackouts are most common in, but are not restricted to, the arctic.
    An arctic blackout may last for days or even weeks during periods of
    intense auroral activity. Past experiments with high-altitude
    nuclear detonations have produced blackouts and artificial auroras
    over the subtropics . 2. A fadeout of radio and telemetry
    transmission between ground stations and vehicles traveling at high
    speeds in the atmosphere caused by signal attenuation in passing
    through ionized boundary layer (plasma sheath) and shock wave
    regions generated by the vehicle. 3. A vacuum tube characteristic
    which results from the formation of a dielectric film on the surface
    of the control grid. A negative charge, accumulated on the film when
    the grid is driven positive with respect to the cathode, affects the
    operating characteristics of the tube. 4. A condition in which
    vision is temporarily obscured by a blackness, accompanied by a
    dullness of certain of the other senses, brought on by decreased
    blood pressure in the eye and a consequent lack of oxygen, as may
    occur, e.g., in pulling out of a high-speed dive in an airplane.
    Compare grayout, redout.
