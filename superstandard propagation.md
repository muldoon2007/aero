# Definition

The propagation of radio waves under conditions of superstandard
refraction (superrefraction) in the atmosphere, that is, refraction by
an atmosphere or section of the atmosphere in which the index of
refraction decreases with height at a rate of greater than 12 N-units
per 1000 feet. See standard propagation, substandard propagation.
Superstandard propagation produces a greater-than-normal downward
bending of radio waves as they travel through the atmosphere, giving
extended radio horizons and increased radar coverage. It results
primarily from propagation through layers near the earth's surface in
which the moisture lapse rate is greater than normal, or the temperature
lapse rate less than normal, or both. A condition in which warn dry air
moves out over a cool water surface is an example of superrefraction. A
layer in which the downward bending is greater than the curvature of the
earth is called a radio duct. Frequently, the general term, anomalous
propagation, is used for superstandard propagation.
