# Definition

For any given cycle of a periodic wave, the maximum absolute value of
the instantaneous sound pressure, without regard to sign, occurring
during that cycle. The unit is the microbar. In the case of a sinusoidal
sound wave, the maximum sound pressure is also called the pressure
amplitude.
