1.  The period of the revolution of the moon around the earth. The month
    is designated as sidereal, tropical, anomalistic, dracontic, or
    synodical, according to whether the revolution is relative to the
    stars, the vernal equinox, the perigee, the ascending node, or the
    sun. 2. The calendar month, which is a rough approximation to the
    synodical month.
