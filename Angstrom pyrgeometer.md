An instrument developed by K. Ångström for measuring the effective
terrestrial radiation. It consists of four manganin strips, of which two
are blackened and two are polished. The blackened strips are allowed to
radiate to the atmosphere while the polished strips are shielded. The
electrical power required to equalize the temperature of the four strips
is taken as a measure of the outgoing radiation. See actinometer,
pyrgeometer. Compare Ångström compensation pyrheliometer.
