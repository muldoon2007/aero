# Definition

1.  Of a periodic quantity, for a particular value of the independent
    variable, the fractional part of a period through which the
    independent variable has advanced, measured from an arbitrary
    reference. The arbitrary reference is generally so chosen that the
    fraction is less than unity. In case of a simple harmonic quantity,
    the reference is often taken as the last previous passage through
    zero from the negative to positive direction. Thus, if two wave
    crest one-fourth cycle apart, they are said to be 90 degrees apart
    in phase, or 90 degrees out of phase. The moon is said to be at
    first quarter when it has completed one-fourth of its cycle from new
    moon. 2. The stage of aggregation of a substance, for example solid,
    liquid, or gas. 3. The extent to which the disk of the moon or the
    planet, as seen from the earth, is illuminated or not illuminated by
    the sun. 4. In astronomy = configuration.
