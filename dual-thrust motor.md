# Definition

A solid-propellant rocket engine built to obtain dual thrust. In a
single chamber unit the booster propellant grain may be bonded to the
sustainer grain, with the thrust level regulated by mechanically
changing the nozzle throat area or by using different grain compositions
or configurations. In a dual-chamber unit, the separate chambers may be
arranged in tandem, or concentrically.
