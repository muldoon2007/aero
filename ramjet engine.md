# Definition

A type of jet engine with no mechanical compressor consisting of a
specially shaped tube or duct open at both ends, the air necessary for
combustion being shoved into the duct and compressed by the forward
motion of the engine, where the air passes through a diffuser and is
mixed with fuel and burned, the exhaust gases issuing in a jet from the
rear opening. The ramjet engine cannot operate under static conditions.
Often called a ramjet. Also called Lorin tube.
