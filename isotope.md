# Definition

1.  On of several nuclides having the same number of protons in their
    nuclei, and hence belonging to the same element, but differing in
    the number of neutrons and therefore in mass number A, or in energy
    content (isomers). For example, 6C612, 6C713, and 6C814 are carbon
    isotopes. Small quantitative differences in chemical properties
    exist between isotopes. 2. A radionuclide or a preparation of an
    element with special isotopic composition (allobar) as an article of
    commerce, so called because of the principal use of such materials
    as radioactive tracers. 3. In common usage, a synonym for nuclide
    (not recommended).
