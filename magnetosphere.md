# Definition

The region of the earth's atmosphere where ionized gas plays an
important part in the dynamics of the atmosphere and where the
geomagnetic field, therefore, plays an important role. The magnetosphere
begins, by convention, at the maximum of the F layer at about 350
kilometers and extends to 10 or 15 earth radii to the boundary between
the atmosphere and the interplanetary plasma.
