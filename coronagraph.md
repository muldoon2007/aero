# Definition

An instrument for photographing the corona and prominences of the sun at
times other than at solar eclipse. An occulting disk is used to block
out the image of the body of the sun in the focal plane of the objective
lens. The light of the corona passes the occulting disk and is focused
on a photographic film. Great care must be taken to avoid light
scattered from the atmosphere and the lenses, and from reflections in
the tube of the instrument. The coronograph is used with a narrow-band
polarizing filter or with a spectroscope.
