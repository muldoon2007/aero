# Definition

A line of cumuliform clouds frequently one cumulus element wide, but
ranging upward in width so that it is sometimes difficult to
differentiate between streets and bands. Typical dimensions are: axis
spacing, 1 to 30 miles; length of cloud streets, 10 to 200 miles; cell
spacing along axis, 1/2 to 2 miles. See cloud band.
