# Definition

A short-baseline continuous-wave phase comparison, trajectory measuring
system, similar to the Cotar which consists of a crossed-baseline
angle-measuring-equipment (AME) system and a
distance-measuring-equipment (DME) system, wherein time sequencing of
the ground station and transponders is used to track multiple targets.
