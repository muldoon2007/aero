# Definition

An instrument which measures, electronically, the direction of arrival,
intensity, and rate of occurrence of atmospherics. In its simplest form
the instrument consists of two orthogonally crossed antennas. Their
output signals are connected to an oscillograph so that one loop
measures the north-south component whereas the other measures the
east-west component. These are combined vertically to give the azimuth.
Also called lightning recorder.
