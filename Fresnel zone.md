# Definition

Any one of the array of concentric surfaces in space between transmitter
and receiver (or between radar antenna and target) over which the
increase in distance over the straight line path is equal to some
multiple of one-half wavelength. Also called half-period zone. See
interference region. Outside of rather unusual multipath transmission of
radio energy in the free atmosphere, Fresnel zones are of importance
primarily in studying the interference lobes produced by the interaction
of a direct and a surface-reflected wave. Thus, for a given path,
reflected radio energy arriving at the receiver from any point along any
of the surface Fresnel zones will be some multiple of 180ï¿½ out of phase
with the direct wave, thereby producing destructive or constructive
interference as the multiple is odd or even, respectively.
