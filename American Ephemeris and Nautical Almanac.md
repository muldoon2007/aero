	- An annual publication of the U.S. Naval Observatory, containing
	  elaborate tables of the predicted positions of various celestial bodies
	  and other data of use to astronomers and navigators. Beginning with the
	  editions for 1960, The American Ephemeris and Nautical Almanac issued by
	  the Nautical Almanac Office, United States Naval Observatory, and the
	  Astronomical Ephemeris issued by H.M. Nautical Almanac Office, Royal
	  Greenwich Observatory, were unified. With the exception of a few
	  introductory pages, the two publications are identical; they are printed
	  separately in the two countries, from reproducible material prepared
	  partly in the United States of America and partly in the United Kingdom.
