# Definition

A factor of 10. Compare octave, magnitude. Two quantities of the same
kind which differ by less than a factor of 10 are said to be of the same
order of magnitude. Order of magnitude is used loosely by many writers
to mean a pronounced difference in quantity but the difference may be
much less or much more than a factor of 10.
