# Definition

1.  The variation in the value of some parameter characterizing a
    periodic oscillation. 2. Specifically, variation of some
    characteristic of a radio wave, called the carrier wave, in
    accordance with instantaneous values of another wave, called the
    modulating wave. Variation of amplitude is amplitude modulation,
    variation of frequency is frequency modulation, and variation of
    phase is phase modulation. The formation of very short bursts of a
    carrier wave, separated by relatively long periods during which no
    carrier wave is transmitted, is pulse modulation.
