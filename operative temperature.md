# Definition

In the study of human bioclimatology, one of several parameters devised
to measure the air's cooling effect upon a human body. It is equal to
the temperature at which a specified hypothetical environment would
support the same heat loss from an unclothed, reclining human body as
the actual environment. In the hypothetical environment, the wall and
air temperatures are equal and the air movement is 7.6 centimeters per
second. From experiment it has been found that the operative temperature
where tr is the mean radiant temperature; ta is the mean air
temperature; ts is the mean skin temperature (all in degrees C); and v
is the airspeed in centimeters per second.
