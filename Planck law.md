# Definition

An expression for the variation of monochromatic radiant flux per unit
area of source as a function of wavelength of black-body radiation at a
given temperature; it is the most fundamental of the radiation laws.
Mathematically, Planck law is dw = \[c1 \* λ -5/(ec2/Tλ - 1)\]dλ where
dw is the radiant flux from a black body in the wavelength interval dλ,
centered around wavelength λ per unit area of black-body surface at
temperature T; c1 and c2 are radiation constants. This law was derived
theoretically by M. Planck in 1901.
