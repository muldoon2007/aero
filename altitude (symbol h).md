# Definition

1.  In astronomy, angular displacement above the horizon; the arc of a
    vertical circle between the horizon and a point on the celestial
    sphere, measured upward from the horizon. Angular displacement below
    the horizon is called negative altitude or dip. See horizon
    system. 2. Height, especially radial distance as measured above a
    given datum, as average sea level. See absolute altitude, true
    altitude. In space navigation altitude designates distance from the
    mean surface of the reference body as contrasted to distance, which
    designates distance from the center of the reference body.
