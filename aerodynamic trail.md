# Definition

A condensation trail formed by adiabatic cooling to saturation (or
slightly supersaturation) of air passing over the surfaces of high-speed
aircraft. Aerodynamic trails form off the tips of wings and propellers
and other points of maximum pressure decrease. They are relatively rare
and of short duration compared to exhaust trails.
