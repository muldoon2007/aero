# Definition

A disturbance which is propagated in a medium in such a manner that at
any point in the medium the quantity serving as measure of disturbance
is a function of the time, while at any instant the displacement at a
point is a function of the position of the point. Any physical quantity
that has the same relationship to some independent variable (usually
time) that a propagated disturbance has, at a particular instant, with
respect to space, may be called a wave.
