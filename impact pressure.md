# Definition

1.  That pressure of a moving fluid brought to rest which is in excess
    of the pressure the fluid has when it does not flow, i.e., total
    pressure less static pressure. Impact pressure is equal to dynamic
    pressure in incompressible flow, but in compressible flow impact
    pressure includes the pressure change owing to the compressibility
    effect. 2. A measured quantity obtained by placing an open-ended
    tube, known as an impact tube or pitot tube, in a gas stream and
    noting the pressure in the tube on a suitable manometer. Since the
    pressure is exerted at a stagnation point, the impact pressure is
    sometimes referred to as the stagnation pressure or total pressure.
