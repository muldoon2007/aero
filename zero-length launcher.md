# Definition

A launcher that holds a vehicle in position and releases the rocket
simultaneously at two points so that the buildup of thrust, normally
rocket thrust, is sufficient to take the missile or vehicle directly
into the air without need of a take-off run and without imposing a pitch
rate release. The term is not normally applied to a pad used for a
vertical launch.
