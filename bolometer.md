# Definition

An instrument which measures the intensity of radiant energy by
employing a thermally sensitive electrical resistor; a type of
actinometer. Also called actinic balance . Compare radiometer. Two
identical, blackened, thermally sensitive electrical resistors are used
in a Wheatstone bridge circuit. Radiation is allowed to fall on one of
the elements, causing a change in its resistance. The change is a
measure of the intensity of the radiation.
