# Definition

In radar, a display in which targets appear as vertical deflections from
a line representing a time base. Also called A-scan or A-scope . Target
distance is indicated by the horizontal position of the deflection from
one end of the time base. The amplitude of the vertical deflection is a
function of the signal intensity.
