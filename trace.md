# Definition

The line appearing on the face of a cathode-ray tube when the visible
dot repeatedly sweeps across the face of the tube as a result of
deflections of the electron beam. See sweep. The path of the dot from
the end of one sweep to the start of the next sweep is called a retrace.
If more than one trace is shown on the same scope, the traces may be
called A-trace, B-trace , etc.
