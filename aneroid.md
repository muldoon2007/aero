# Definition

A thin, disk-shaped box or capsule, usually metallic, partially
evacuated of air and sealed, which expands and contracts with changes in
atmospheric or gaseous pressure. The aneroid is the sensing and
actuating element in various meters or gages, such as barometers,
altimeters, manifold-pressure gages, etc; it is also the triggering or
operating element in various automatic mechanisms. A device similar to
an aneroid, but open to outside pressures, such as the capsule in an
airspeed indicator, is not commonly called an aneroid .
