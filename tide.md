# Definition

The periodic rising and falling of the earth's oceans and atmosphere. It
results from the gravitational forces of the moon and sun acting upon
the rotating earth. The disturbance actually propagates as a wave
through the atmosphere and along the surface of the waters of the earth.
Atmospheric tides are always so designated, whereas the term tide alone
commonly implies the oceanic variety.
