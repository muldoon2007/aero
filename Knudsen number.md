# Definition

A number used to describe the flow of a low density gas, equal to the
ratio λ/l where λ is the mean free path of the gas molecule and l is a
characteristic length, such as boundary layer thickness, or apparatus
dimension. The Knudsen number is used most commonly to define the extend
to which the gas behaves like a collection of independent particles
(free-molecule regime, Knudsen number much larger than unity), or like a
viscous fluid (continuous regime, Knudsen number much smaller than
unity). Intermediate regimes are termed transition region, and slip flow
region. See rarefied gas dynamics, note.
