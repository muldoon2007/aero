# Definition

A filamentlike protuberance from the chromosphere of the sun. See
flocculi. Compare flare. Prominences can be observed visually
(optically) whenever the sun's disk is masked, as during an eclipse or
by using a coronagraph; and can be observed instrumentally by filtering
in certain wavelengths, as with a spectroheliograph. A typical
prominence is 6,000 to 12,000 kilometers thick, 60,000 kilometers high,
and 200,000 kilometers long.
