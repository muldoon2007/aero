# Definition

The locus of points at which direct rays from a radio transmitter become
tangential to the earth's surface. Assuming a smooth surface, the
distance of the horizon is given approximately by the equation where r
is the distance, statute miles, and h is the height, feet, of the
antenna above the surface. See effective radius of the earth, scatter
propagation. Compare radar horizon. The horizon extends beyond (below)
the geometrical and visible horizons as the result of normal atmospheric
refraction. It may be decreased or increased in particular cases as
standard propagation is replaced by substandard propagation or
superstandard propagation, respectively. Beyond the radio horizon,
surface targets cannot be detected under normal atmospheric conditions
although significant amounts of radio power have been detected in the
diffraction zone below the horizon. It is now felt that this represents
power scattered by turbulence-produced atmospheric inhomogeneities.
