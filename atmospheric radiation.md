# Definition

Infrared radiation emitted by or being propagated through the
atmosphere. See insolation. Atmospheric radiation, lying almost entirely
within the wavelength interval of from 3 to 80 microns, provides one of
the most important mechanisms by which the heat balance of the
earth-atmosphere system is maintained. Infrared radiation emitted by the
earth's surface (terrestrial radiation) is partially absorbed by the
water vapor of the atmosphere which in turn remits it, partly upward,
partly downward. This secondarily emitted radiation is then, in general,
repeatedly absorbed and reemitted, as the radiant energy progresses
through the atmosphere. The downward flux, or counterradiation, is of
basic importance in the greenhouse effect; the upward flux is essential
to the radiative balance of the planet.
