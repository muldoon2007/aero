# Definition

The error in radar range measurement due to the propagation of radio
energy through a nonhomogeneous atmosphere. This error is due to the
fact that the velocity of radio-wave propagation varies with the index
of refraction and that ray travel is not in straight lines through
actual atmospheres. The resulting range error is generally
insignificant. Compare azimuth error.
