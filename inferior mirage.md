# Definition

A spurious image of an object formed below the true position of that
object by abnormal refraction conditions along the line of sight; one of
the most common of all types of mirage and the opposite of a superior
mirage. The requirement for the appearance of an inferior mirage is a
very large lapse rate of temperature in the layer of air containing the
line of sight from observer to object. Compare sinking, stooping.
