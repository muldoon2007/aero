# Definition

A body of revolution formed by rotating a circular arc about an axis
that intersects the arc; the shape of this body; also, a nose of a
projectile or the like so shaped. Typically, an ogive has the outline of
a Gothic arch, although by definition it may be rounded rather than
pointed. See tangent ogive.
