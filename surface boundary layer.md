# Definition

That thin layer of air adjacent to the earth's surface, extending up to
the so-called anamometer level (the base of the Ekman layer). Within
this layer the wind distribution is determined largely by the vertical
temperature gradient and the nature and contours of the underlying
surface; shearing stresses are approximate constant. Also called surface
layer, friction layer, atmospheric boundary layer, ground layer. See
logarithmic velocity profile, planetary boundary layer, free atmosphere.
