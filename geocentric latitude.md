# Definition

Of a position in the earth's surface; the angle between a line to the
center of the earth and the plane of the equator. Because the earth is
approximately an oblate spheroid, rather than a true sphere, this
differs from geographic latitude, the maximum difference being 11.6
minutes of arc at latitude 45 degrees.
