# Definition

Imaginary lines so drawn in a region containing a magnetic field to be
everywhere tangent to the magnetic field intensity vector if in vacuum
or nonmagnetic material, or parallel to the magnetic induction vector if
in a magnetic medium. See electric lines of force. As so defined, these
lines of force are merely convenient artifices for delineating the
geometry of a magnetic field. They are given quantitative significance
in magnetic theory by associating one line of force per square
centimeter normal to the force for every oersted of field intensity (in
vacuum), for every gauss of magnetic induction (in magnetic media).
