The hypothesis, by Sir Isaac Newton, that light consists of a stream of
minute particles emitted by luminous bodies at very high velocities, and
that the sensation of light, is due to the bombardment of the retina of
the eye by these particles. Although this theory was later replaced by
the wave theory of light, the concept of photons in the modern quantum
theory is reminiscent of Newton theory.
