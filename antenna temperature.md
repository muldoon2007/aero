# Definition

In radio astronomy, a measure of the power absorbed by the antenna. In
an ideal, loss-free radio telescope, the antenna temperature is equal to
the brightness temperature if the intensity of the received radiation is
constant within the main lobe. If the angular dimension of the source is
small compared to the main lobe, the antenna temperature is equal to the
brightness temperature multiplied by the ratio of the solid angle
subtended by the source to the effective solid angle of the antenna.
