# Definition

1.  A scale encircling the plan position indicator (PPI) scope of a
    radar on which the azimuth of a target from the radar may be
    measured. 2. Reference limits inserted electronically at 10° or 15°
    intervals which extend radially from the relative position of the
    radar on an off center PPI scope. These are employed for target
    azimuth determination when the radar position is not at the center
    of the PPI scope and hence the fixed azimuth scale on the edge of
    the scope cannot be employed. On such markers north is usually 0°,
    east 90°, etc. Occasionally, on ship or airborne radars, 0° is used
    to indicate the direction in which the craft is heading, in which
    cases the relative bearing, not azimuth, of the target is indicated.
