# Definition

The collision of two particles both of which are charged. In this case
the collision cross section is considerably larger than when one of the
particles is neutral because the electric field of the two particles can
interact at much larger distances. Since the collisions are distant
ones, however, the particles will suffer only a small angular deviation.
