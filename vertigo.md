# Definition

The sensation that the outer world is revolving about the patient (
objective vertigo ) or that he himself is moving in space ( subjective
vertigo ). The word frequently is used erroneously as a synonym for
dizziness or giddiness to indicate an unpleasant sensation of disturbed
relations to surrounding objects in space.
