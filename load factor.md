# Definition

A number which yields the inertial load when multiplied by the weight of
an object. The load factor for a rocket is obtained by dividing the sum
of the external forces by the weight of the rocket. For example, the
longitudinal load factor n, is: n = (F - D)/W where F is rocket thrust;
D is aerodynamic drag; and W is weight of missile. The force of gravity
does not appear in the sum of external forces because, on each particle
of mass, the gravity is canceled by the inertial force of free-fall
acceleration.
