# Definition

1.  The reduction in visibility or disappearance of a nonluminous body
    by passing into the shadow cast by another nonluminous body. 2. The
    apparent cutting off, wholly or partially, of the light from a
    luminous body by a dark body coming between it and the observer. 1.
    The first type of eclipse is exemplified by a lunar eclipse, the
    moon passing through the shadow cast by the earth; or by the passage
    of a satellite into the shadow cast by its planet; but when the
    satellite actually passes directly behind its planet, it may
    properly be termed an occultation. 2. The second type of eclipse is
    exemplified by a solar eclipse, caused by the moon passing between
    the sun and the earth. If the relative positions and distances are
    such that at a point on the earth the sun is completely obscured,
    the eclipse is total; if the distances are such that, when in line
    with the sun, the moon is surrounded by a ring of light, the eclipse
    is annular; and when the moon passes to one side of a straight line
    from sun to observer and shows a crescent of light, it is a partial
    eclipse.
