# Definition

A state of fluid flow in which the instantaneous velocities exhibit
irregular and apparently random fluctuations so that in practice only
statistical properties can be recognized and subjected to analysis.
Compare laminar flow. These fluctuations often constitute major
deformations of the flow and are capable of transporting momentum,
energy, and suspended matter at rates far in excess of the rate of
transport by the molecular processes of diffusion and conduction in a
nonturbulent or laminar flow.
