# Definition

A vacuum gage in which tangential momentum is transported (viscous
transport) by gas molecules from a rapidly rotating member (usually in
the form of a disk or cylinder) to a nearby movable member restrained by
a restoring torque which can be correlated with gas pressure. Also
called molecular gage, rotating disk gage, rotating cylinder gage.
