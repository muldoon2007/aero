# Definition

The shearing flow of a fluid between two parallel surfaces in relative
motion. A two-dimensional steady flow without pressure gradient in the
direction of flow and caused by the tangential movement of the bounding
surfaces. The only practical type is the flow between concentric
rotating cylinders (as of the oil in a cylindrical bearing).
