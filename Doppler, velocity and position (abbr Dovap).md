# Definition

A continuous-wave trajectory measuring system using the Doppler effect
caused by a target moving relative to a ground transmitter and receiving
stations. The transmitter interrogates a frequency doubling transponder
and the output is received at three or more receiver sites for
comparison with the interrogation frequency. The intersection of
ellipsoids formed by the transmitter and each receiver site provides the
spatial position of the target.
