# Definition

The full complement of secondary charged particles (usually limited to
electrons) associated with an X-ray or gamma ray beam in its passage
through matter. The full complement of electrons is obtained after the
radiation has traversed sufficient matter to bring about equilibrium
between the primary photons and secondary electrons. Electronic
equilibrium with the secondary photons is intentionally excluded.
