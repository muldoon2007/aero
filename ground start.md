# Definition

An ignition sequence of a rocket's main stage, initiated and cycled
through on the ground. Compare air start, in-flight start. In large
rockets, the ground start may be fueled from pressurized tanks external
to the rocket, permitting takeoff with the rocket's own internal
propellant load intact.
