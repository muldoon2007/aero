# Definition

1.  An angle equal to 90� minus a given angle. Thus, 50� is the
    complement of 40�, and the two are said to be complementary. See
    explement. 2. The true complement of any quantity in positional
    notation, i.e., the quantity which, when added to the first
    quantity, gives the least quantity containing one more place. 3. The
    base-minus-one complement of any quantity in positional notation;
    i.e., the quantity which, when added to the first quantity, gives
    the largest quantity containing the same number of places. In many
    computing machines a negative quantity is represented as a
    complement of the corresponding positive quantity.
