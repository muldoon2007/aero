# Definition

1.  In astrophysics, a measure of the temperature of a star deduced by
    means of the Stefan-Boltzmann law, from the total energy emitted per
    unit area. Compare brightness temperature, color temperature.
    Effective temperature is always less than actual temperature. 2. In
    physiology, the temperature at which motionless, saturated air would
    induce, in a sedentary worker wearing ordinary indoor clothing, the
    same sensation of comfort as that induced by the actual conditions
    of temperature, humidity, and air movement. Compare sensible
    temperature, standard operative temperature, operative temperature.
    Effective temperature is used as a guide in air-conditioning
    practice, and, on the comfort chart (American Society of Heating and
    Air Conditioning Engineers) it appears as a family of curves which
    serves as one coordinate in defining comfort zones.
