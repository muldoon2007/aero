# Definition

Angle modulation of a sine-wave carrier in which the instantaneous
frequency of the modulated wave differs from the carrier frequency by an
amount proportional to the instantaneous value of the modulating wave.
Compare pulse modulation, amplitude modulation, phase modulation,
intensity modulation. Combinations of phase and frequency modulation are
commonly referred to as frequency modulation.
