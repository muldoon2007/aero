# Definition

1.  Any device inserted in an environment for the purpose of obtaining
    information about the environment. 2. In geophysics, a device used
    to make a sounding. 3. Specifically, an instrumented vehicle moving
    through the upper atmosphere or space or landing upon another
    celestial body in order to obtain information about the specific
    environment. In sense 3, almost any instrumented spacecraft can be
    considered a probe. However, earth satellites are not usually
    referred to as probes. Also, almost any instrumented rocket can be
    considered a probe. In practice, rockets which attain an altitude of
    less than 1 earth radius (400 miles) are called sounding rockets,
    those which attain an altitude of more that 1 earth radius are
    called probes or space probes. Spacecraft which enter into orbit
    around the sun are called deep-space probes. Spacecraft designed to
    pass near or land on another celestial body are often designated
    lunar probe, Martian probe, Venus probe, etc. 4. Specifically, a
    slender device or apparatus projected into a moving fluid, as for
    measurement purposes; a pitot tube. 5. Specifically, a slender
    projecting pipe on an aircraft which is thrust into a drogue to
    receive fuel in inflight refueling.
