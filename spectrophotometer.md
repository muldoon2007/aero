# Definition

A photometer which measures the intensity of radiation as a function of
the frequency (or wavelength) of the radiation. Also called
spectroradiometer. See Dobson spectrophotometer. In one design,
radiation enters the spectrophotometer through a slit and is dispersed
by means of a prism. A bolometer having a fixed aperture scans the
dispersed radiation so that the intensity over a narrow wave band is
obtained as a function of frequency.
