# Definition

That region in space in which interference between wave trains occurs.
In microwave propagation, it refers to the region bounded by the ray
path and the surface of the earth which is above the radio horizon.
Interference lobes and height-gain patterns are formed in this region by
the addition of the direct and the surface-reflected wave. In contrast
is the diffraction zone which lies below the radio horizon.
