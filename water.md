# Definition

Dihydrogen oxide (molecular formula H20). The word is used ambiguously
to refer to the chemical compound in general and to its liquid phase;
when the former is meant, the term water substance is often used. Water
is distinguished from other common terrestrial substances in existing in
all three phases at atmospheric temperatures and pressures (see ice,
water vapor). The phase changes, are of great significance in many
geophysical processes. The same is true of the large specific heat of
liquid water and ice relative to both land surface and atmosphere.
Water's complex absorption spectrum gives rise to the greenhouse effect.
