# Definition

1.  Either of the two places on the surface of the earth where the
    magnetic dip is 90 �, that in the Northern Hemisphere (at,
    approximately, latitude 73� 8 N, longitude, 101� W in 1955) being
    designated north magnetic pole , and that in the Southern Hemisphere
    (at, approximately, latitude, 68� S, longitude, 144� E in 1955)
    being designated south magnetic pole. Also called dip pole. See
    geomagnetic latitude, geomagnetic pole, magnetic latitude. 2. Either
    of those two points of a magnet where the magnetic force is
    greatest. 3. In magnetic theory, a fictitious entity analogous to a
    unit electric charge of electrostatic theory. In nature only
    dipoles, not isolated magnetic poles, exist.
