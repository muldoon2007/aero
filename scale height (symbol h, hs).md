# Definition

A measure of the relationship between density and temperature of any
point in an atmosphere; the thickness of a homogeneous atmosphere which
would give the observed temperature: h = kT/mg = R\*T/Mg where k is the
Boltzmann constant; T is the absolute temperature; m and M are the mean
molecular mass and weight, respectively, of the layer; g is the
acceleration of gravity; and R\* is the universal gas constant. Compare
virtual height.
