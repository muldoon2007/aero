# Definition

A unit of index of refraction in the atmosphere; a mathematical
simplification designed to replace rather awkward numbers involved in
the values of the index of refraction n for the atmosphere. It is
defined by the relation N = (n - 1) 10E6 Thus, if n = 1.000326, then N =
326. Correspondingly, M-units are used for modified index of refraction,
and B-units for potential index of refraction.
