# Definition

That attribute of auditory sensation by which a listener discriminates
between two sounds of similar loudness and pitch, but of different tonal
quality. Timbre depends primarily upon the spectrum of the stimulus, but
it also depends upon the waveform, the sound pressure, the frequency
location of the spectrum, and the temporal characteristics of the
stimulus.
