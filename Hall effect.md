# Definition

The electrical polarization of a horizontal conducting sheet of limited
extent, when that sheet moves laterally through a magnetic field having
a component vertical to the sheet. The Hall effect is important in
determining the behavior of the electrical currents generated by winds
in the lower ionosphere.
