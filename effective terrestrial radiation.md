# Definition

The amount by which outgoing infrared terrestrial radiation of the
earth's surface exceeds downcoming infrared counter-radiation from the
atmosphere. Also called nocturnal radiation, effective radiation. See
actinometer. It is to be emphasized that this amount is a positive
quantity, of the order of several tenths of a langley per minute, at all
times of day (except under conditions of low overcast clouds). It
typically attains its diurnal maximum during the midday hours when high
soil temperatures create high rates of outgoing terrestrial radiation.
(For this reason the synonym nocturnal radiation is apt to lead to
slight confusion.) However, in daylight hours the effective terrestrial
radiation is generally much smaller than the insolation, while at night
it typically dominates the energy budget of the earth's surface.
