# Definition

In acoustics, the logarithm of the ratio of that quantity to a reference
quantity of the same kind. The base of the logarithm, the reference
quantity, and the kind of level must be specified. Examples of kinds of
levels in common use are electric power level, sound-pressure-squared
level, voltage-squared level. Level as here defined is measured in units
of the logarithm of a reference ratio that is equal to the base of
logarithms. In symbols, L = logr (q/q0) where L is level of kind
determined by the kind of quantity under consideration, measured in
units of log r ; r is the base of logarithms and the reference ratio; q
is the quantity under consideration; and q0 is the reference quantity of
the same kind. Differences in the levels of two like quantities q 1 and
q2 are described by the same formula because, by the rules of
logarithms, the reference quantity is automatically divided out: logr
(q1 /q0) - logr (q2 /q0) = logr (q1 /q2).
