# Definition

Any of the quantities defining the thermodynamic state of substance in
thermodynamic equilibrium. Also called thermodynamic variable, state
variable, state parameter. For a perfect gas, pressure, temperature, and
density are the fundamental thermodynamic variables, any two of which
are, by the equation of state, sufficient to specify the state.
Quantities defined in terms of these, such as specific volume, potential
temperature, etc., may also be used as thermodynamic functions of state.
If the composition of the gas varies, this must be specified. Thus, some
measure of water vapor is a thermodynamic function of state of the
atmosphere.
