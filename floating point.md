# Definition

In computer operations, a positional notation in which corresponding
places in different quantities are not necessarily occupied by
coefficient of the same power of the base. Compare fixed point. Floating
point corresponds to multiplication using powers of 10; for example,
186,000 can be represented as 1.86 \* 105. By shifting the point so that
the number of significant digits in any quantity does not exceed machine
capacity, widely varying quantities can be handled. The scale factor may
be fixed for each problem, or indicated along with the digits and sign
for each quantity.
