# Definition

A radar beacon with a very fast recovery time. This recovery time
provides the possibility of simultaneously interrogating and tracking
the beacon by as many radars as required so long as they are phased,
synchronized, or the sum total pulse recurrence frequency does not
exceed the maximum pulse recurrence frequency characteristics of the
beacon.
