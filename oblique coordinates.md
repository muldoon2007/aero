# Definition

Magnitudes defining a point relative to two intersecting
nonperpendicular lines, called axes. See Cartesian coordinates. The
magnitude indicate the distance from each axis, measured along a
parallel to the other side. The horizontal distance is called the
abscissa and the other distance, the ordinate.
