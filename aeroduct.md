# Definition

A ramjet type of engine designed to scoop up ions and electrons freely
available in the outer reaches of the atmosphere or in the atmospheres
of other spatial bodies, and by a metachemical process within the duct
of this engine, expel particles derived from the ions and electrons as a
propulsive jetstream.
