# Definition

The layer of fluid in the immediate vicinity of a bounding surface; in
fluid mechanics, the layer affected by viscosity of the fluid, referring
ambiguously to the laminar boundary layer, turbulent boundary layer,
planetary boundary layer, or surface boundary layer . In aerodynamics
the boundary-layer thickness is measured from the surface to an
arbitrarily chosen point, e.g., where the velocity is 99 percent of the
stream velocity. Thus, in aerodynamics, boundary layer by selection of
the reference point, can include only the laminar boundary layer or the
laminar boundary layer plus all, or a portion of, the turbulent boundary
layer.
