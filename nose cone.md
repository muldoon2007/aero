# Definition

The cone-shaped leading end of a rocket vehicle, consisting (a) of a
chamber or chambers in which a satellite, instruments, animals, plants,
or auxiliary equipment may be carried, and (b) of an outer surface built
to withstand high temperatures generated by aerodynamic heating. In a
satellite vehicle, the nose cone may become the satellite itself after
separating from the final stage of the rocket or it may be used to
shield the satellite until orbital speed is accomplished, then
separating from the satellite.
