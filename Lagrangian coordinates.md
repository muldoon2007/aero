# Definition

1.  A system of coordinates by which fluid parcels are identified for
    all time by assigning them coordinates which do not vary with time.
    Examples of such coordinates are: (a) the values of any properties
    of the fluid conserved in the motion; or (b) more generally, the
    positions in space of the parcels at some arbitrarily selected
    moment. Subsequent positions in space of the parcels at some
    arbitrarily selected moment. Subsequent positions in space of the
    parcels are then the dependent variables, functions of time and of
    the Lagrangian coordinates. Also called material coordinates.
    Compare Eulerian coordinates. See Lagrangian equations. 2. Same as
    generalized coordinates.
