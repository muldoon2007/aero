# Definition

A variable characterized by random behavior in assuming its different
possible values. Mathematically, it is described by its probability
distribution, which specifies the possible values of a random variables
together with the probability associated (in an appropriate sense) with
each value. A random variable is said to be continuous if its possible
values extend over a continuum and discrete if its possible values are
separated by finite intervals. Also called variate. See probability
theory.
