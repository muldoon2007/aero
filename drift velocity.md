# Definition

The average velocity of a charged particle in a plasma in response to an
applied electric field. The motion of an individual particle is quite
erratic as it bounces off other particles and has its direction
continually changed. On the average, however, a particle will slowly
work its way in the direction of the applied electric force. This
velocity is usually much smaller than the random velocity of the
particle between collisions.
