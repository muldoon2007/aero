# Definition

In a system of moist air, the (dimensionless) ratio of the mass of water
vapor to the total mass of the system. The specific humidity may be
approximated by the mixing ratio for many purposes: q = w /(1 + w )
where q is the specific humidity and w is the mixing ratio. See absolute
humidity, relative humidity, dew point.
