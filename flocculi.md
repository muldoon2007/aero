# Definition

Patches of relatively dense, dark or bright clouds in the sun's
atmosphere. They appear in photographs taken with the spectroheliograph.
The emission spectra usually studied are those of calcium and hydrogen;
e.g., bright calcium flocculi, and dark or bright hydrogen flocculi.
Measures of the extent of these three kinds of flocculi are tabulated in
the quarterly Bulletin of Character Figures of Solar Phenomena, Zurich,
Int. Astron. Union.
