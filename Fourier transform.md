# Definition #space101 #card

An analytical transformation of a function $f(x)$ obtained (if it
exists) by multiplying the function by e-iux and integrating over
all x, where u is the new variable of the transform $F(u)$ and $i2=-1$

If the Fourier transform of a function is known, the function
itself may be recovered by use of the inversion formula: The Fourier
transform has the same uses as the Fourier series: for example, the
integrand $F(u) exp (iux)$ is a solution of a given linear
differential equation, so that the integral sum of these solutions
is the most general solution of the equation. When the variable u is
complex, the Fourier transform is equivalent to the Laplace
transform. See [[Fourier integral]] , [[spectral function]] .
