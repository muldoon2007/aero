# Definition

A double-reflecting instrument for measuring angles, primarily altitudes
of celestial bodies. As originally used, the term applied only to
instruments having an arc of 60 degrees, a sixth of a circle, from which
the instrument derived its name. Such an instrument had a range of 120
degrees. In modern practice the term applies to a similar instrument,
regardless of its range, very few modern instruments being sextants in
the original sense.
