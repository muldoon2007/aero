# Definition

A quantity in the kinetic theory of gases which measures the tendency of
gases to diffuse into one another in nonturbulent flow. This diffusion
coefficient is a property of the gases in question and of the assumed
nature of the molecular impacts in the diffusion process. For rigid,
perfectly elastic, spherical molecules the coefficient of mutual
diffusion d1,2 is, in square centimeters per second, where n is
Loschmidt number (the number of molecules per cubic centimeter); 1, 2
and m1, m2 are the effective molecular diameters and masses of the two
gases, respectively; T is the temperature,ï¿½K; and k is Boltzmann
constant.
