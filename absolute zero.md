# Definition

The theoretical temperature at which molecular motion vanishes and a
body would have no heat energy; the zero point of the Kelvin and Rankine
temperature scales. Absolute zero may be interpreted as the temperature
at which the volume of a perfect gas vanishes or, more generally, as the
temperature of the cold source which would render a Carnot cycle 100
percent efficient. The value of absolute zero is now estimated to be -
273.15째 Celsius, -459.67째 Fahrenheit, 0째 Kelvin, and 0째 Rankine.
