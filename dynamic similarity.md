# Definition

The relationship existing between a model and its prototype when, by
virtue of similarity between their geometric dimensions and mass
distributions or elastic characteristics, the motion of the model in
some respect (such as linear velocity, acceleration, vibration, flutter,
etc.) is similar to the motion of the prototype; also, the similarity
between the fluid flow about a scale model and its prototype when the
flows have the same Reynolds number.
