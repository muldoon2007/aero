# Definition

A radio wave that is propagated over the earth and is ordinarily
affected by the presence of the earth's surface and the troposphere. The
ground wave includes all components of a radio wave over the earth
except ionospheric and tropospheric waves. Compare sky wave. The ground
wave is refracted because of variations in the dielectric constant of
the troposphere including the condition known as a surface duct.
