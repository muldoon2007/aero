# Definition

The apparatus comprising those components of an aircraft or spacecraft
that support and provide mobility for the craft on land, water, or other
surface. The landing gear consists of wheels, floats, skis, bogies, and
treads, or other devices, together will all associated struts, bracing
shock absorbers, etc. Landing gear includes all supporting components,
such as the tail wheel or tail skid, outrigger wheels or pontoons, etc.,
but the term is often conceived to apply only to the principle
components, i.e., to the main wheels, floats, etc., and the nose gear,
if any. See auxiliary landing gear.
