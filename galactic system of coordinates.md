# Definition

An astronomical coordinate system using latitude measured north and
south from the galactic equator and longitude measured in the sense of
increasing right ascension from 0 to 360 degrees. See coordinate, table.
Galactic latitude is designated b, galactic longitude l. The reference
points for galactic coordinates were changed by action of the
International Astronomical Union in 1958. The new values are: the north
galactic pole lies in the direction right ascension = 12 hours 49
minutes, declination = 27.4 degrees N (equinox 1950); the new zero of
longitude is the great semicircle originating at the new north galactic
pole at the position angle 0 = 123 degrees with respect to the
equatorial pole for 1950.
