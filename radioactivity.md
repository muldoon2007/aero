# Definition

1.  Spontaneous disintegration of atomic nuclei with emission of
    corpuscular or electromagnetic radiations. The principal types of
    radioactivity are alpha decay, beta decay, and isomeric transition.
    To be considered as radioactive a process must have a measurable
    lifetime between approximately 10E-10 second and approximately 10E17
    years. Radiations emitted within a time too short for measurement
    are called prompt. Prompt radiations such as gamma rays and X-rays
    are often associated with radioactive disintegrations. 2. The number
    of spontaneous disintegrations per unit mass and per unit time of a
    given unstable (radioactive) element, usually measured in curies.
