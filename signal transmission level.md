# Definition

In a transmission system, the signal level, of a kind to be specified,
at a designated position in the system. The signal level at some
specified position near the source may be taken as the zero reference
level. In an acoustic system the signal level is often in the form of a
sound pressure level; either the reference sound pressure or the
reference sound pressure level must be specified.
