# Definition

A set of equations in which the independent variables or coordinates are
each expressed in terms of a parameter. For example, instead of
investigating y = f(x) or F(x,y) = 0 it is often advantageous to express
both x and y in terms of a parameter u: x = g(u); y = G(u). The
parameter may or may not have a useful geometric or physical
interpretation.
