# Definition

1.  The atmospheric shell, in which temperature generally decreases with
    heights, extending from the stratopause at about 50 to 55 kilometers
    to the mesopause at about 80 to 85 kilometers. 2. The atmospheric
    shell between the top of the ionosphere (the top of this region has
    never been clearly defined) and the bottom of the exosphere. (This
    definition has not gained general acceptance.)
