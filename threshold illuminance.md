# Definition

The lowest value of illuminance which the eye is capable of detecting
under specified conditions of background luminance and degree of dark
adaptation of the eye. Also called flux-density threshold. Compare
threshold contrast. See Allard law. This threshold, which controls the
visibility of point light sources, especially at night, cannot be
assigned any universal value, but nonflashing lights can generally be
seen by a fully dark-adapted eye when the lights yield an illuminance of
the order of 0.1 lumen per square kilometer at the eye.
