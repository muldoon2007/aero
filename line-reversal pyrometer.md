# Definition

A thermometer for high-temperature gases in which the temperature of a
calibrated radiator is adjusted until the spectral areal radiant
intensity of its continuum radiation is equal to the intensity of
radiation from some suitable characteristic spectral line emitted by the
gas. The comparison is made at the wavelength of the spectral line.
Seeding is often used to create such a line.
