# Definition

In vacuum technology, the quantity of gas in pressure-volume units at a
specified temperature flowing per unit time across a specified open
section of a pump or pipeline. The specified temperature may be the
actual temperature of the gas or a standard reference temperature. It is
recommended that throughput be referred to standard room temperature.
The recommended unit of throughput is the torr liter per second at 20
degrees C. Other units of throughput in common use are micron liters per
second at 25 degrees C and micron cubic feet per minute at 68 degrees F.
Under conditions of steady-state conservative flow the throughput across
the entrance to a pipe is equal to the throughput at the exit. In this
case throughput can be defined as the quantity of gas flowing through a
pipe in pressure-volume units per unit time at room temperature.
