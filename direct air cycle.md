# Definition

A thermodynamic propulsion cycle involving a nuclear reactor and gas
turbine or ramjet engine, in which air is the working fluid. Also called
direct cycle. Air is successively compressed in the compressor section,
heated in the nuclear reactor, and expelled through the turbine-tailpipe
section to obtain thrust.
