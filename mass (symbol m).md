# Definition

A quantity characteristic of a body, which relates the attraction of
this body toward another body. Since the mass of a body is not fixed in
magnitude, all masses are referred to the standard kilogram, which is a
lump of platinum. Mass of a body always has the same value; weight
changes with change in the acceleration of gravity.
