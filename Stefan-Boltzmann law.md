# Definition

One of the radiation laws which states that the amount of energy
radiated per unit time from a unit surface area of an ideal black body
is proportional to the fourth power of the absolute temperature of the
black body. The law is written: E = σT4 where E is the emittance of the
black body; σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant; and T is the absolute
temperature of the black body. Also called Stefan law. This law was
established experimentally by Stefan and was given theoretical support
by thermodynamic reasoning due to Boltzmann. This law may be deduced by
integrating Planck law over the entire frequency spectrum.
