# Definition

A cycle with an average length of 11.1 years but varying between about 7
and 17 years in the number and area of sunspots, as given by the
relative sunspot number. This number rises from a minimum of 0 to 10 to
a maximum of 50 to 140 about 4 years later, and then declines more
slowly. An approximate 11-year cycle has been found or suggested in
geomagnetism, frequency of aurora, and other ionospheric
characteristics. The u-index of geomagnetic intensity variation shows
one of the strongest known correlations to solar activity. Eleven-year
cycles have been suggested for various tropospheric phenomena, but none
of these has been substantiated.
