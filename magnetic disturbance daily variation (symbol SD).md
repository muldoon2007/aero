# Definition

A periodic variation of the earth's magnetic field that is in phase with
solar (local) time. It is the difference between the solar daily
variation (or the disturbed-day solar daily variation) and the quiet-day
solar daily variation. This variation is primarily an effect of enhanced
electromagnetic radiation during increased solar activity.
