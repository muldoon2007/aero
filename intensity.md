# Definition

1.  In general, the degree or amount, usually expressed by the elemental
    time rate or spatial distribution of some condition or physical
    quantity, such as electric field, sound, magnetism, etc. 2. With
    respect to electromagnetic radiation, a measure of the radiant flux
    per unit solid angle emanating for some source. Frequently, it is
    desirable to specify this as radiant intensity in order to
    distinguish it clearly for luminous intensity. Compare emittance.
    Occasionally, intensity, is used as synonymous to flux density. This
    usage does not coincide with accepted photometric and radiometric
    usage, but is of long standing in meteorology. See sound intensity.
