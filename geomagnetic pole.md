# Definition

Either of two antipodal points marking the intersection of the earth's
surface with the extended axis of a dipole assumed to be located at the
center of the earth and approximating the source of the actual magnetic
field of the earth. That pole in the Northern Hemisphere (latitude, 78
1/2 degrees N; longitude, 69 degrees W) is designated north geomagnetic
pole, and that pole in the Southern Hemisphere (latitude, 78 1/2 degrees
S, longitude, 111 degrees E) is designated south geomagnetic pole. The
great circle midway between these poles is called geomagnetic equator.
The expression geomagnetic pole should not be confused with magnetic
pole, which relates to the actual magnetic field of the earth. See
geomagnetic latitude.
