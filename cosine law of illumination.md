# Definition

A purely geometric relationship between the illuminance of a surface and
the angle of incidence of the illuminating rays. Mathematically, the
illuminance I of the surface illuminated by a beam of flux density F
incident at angle is I = F cos The marked latitudinal variation in
insolation on the earth is largely a consequence of this simple
relationship. Compare Lambert law.
