# Definition

The unit of pressure in the CGS system and equal to 1 dyne per square
centimeter; the unit of sound pressure. In British literature the term
barye has been used. The term bar properly denotes a pressure of 106
dynes per square centimeter. Unfortunately, the bar was once used in
acoustics to mean 1 dyne per square centimeter, but this is no longer
correct.
