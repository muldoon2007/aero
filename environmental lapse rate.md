# Definition

The rate of decrease of temperature T with elevation z in the
atmosphere, - T / z or occasionally T / p, where p is pressure. See
autoconvective lapse rate, superadiabatic lapse rate. The concept may be
applied to other atmospheric variables (e.g., lapse rate of density) if
these are specified. The environmental lapse rate is determined by the
distribution of temperature in the vertical at a given time and place
and should be carefully distinguished from the process lapse rate, which
applies to an individual air parcel.
