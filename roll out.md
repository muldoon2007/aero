In computer terminology, to read out of a storage device by
simultaneously increasing by one the value of the digit in each column
and repeating this r times (where r is the radix) and, at the instant
the representation changes from ( r - 1) to zero: generating a
particular signal, or terminating a sequence of signals, or originating
a sequence of signals.
