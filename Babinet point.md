# Definition

One of the three commonly detectable points of zero polarization of
diffuse sky radiation, neutral points, lying along the vertical circle
through the sun; the other two are the Arago point and Brewster point.
The Babinet point typically lies only 15� to 20� above the sun, and
hence is difficult to observe because of solar glare. The existence of
this neutral point was discovered by Babinet in 1840.
