# Definition

1.  A dimensionless measure of the ratio of two powers, equal to 10
    times the logarithm to the base 10 of the ratio of two powers
    P1/P2. 2. One-tenth of a bel. The power P2 may be some reference
    power; in electricity, the reference power is sometimes taken as 1
    milliwatt (abbr dbm); in acoustics, the decibel is often taken as 20
    times the common logarithm of the sound pressure ratio, with the
    reference pressure as 0.0002 dyne per square centimeter.
