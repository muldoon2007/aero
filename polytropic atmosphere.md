# Definition

A model atmosphere in hydrostatic equilibrium with a constant nonzero
lapse rate. The vertical distribution of pressure and temperature is
given by p/p0 = (T/T0)g/Rγ where p is the pressure; T is the Kelvin
temperature; g is the acceleration of gravity; R is the gas constant for
the gases concerned; and γ is the environmental lapse rate. The
subscript 0 denotes values at the planet's surface.
