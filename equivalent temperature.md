# Definition

1.  Isobaric equivalent temperature; the temperature that an air parcel
    would have if all water vapor were condensed out at constant
    pressure, the latent heat released being used to heat the air, Ti, e
    = T \[1 + (Lw / cp T)\] where Ti, e is the isobaric equivalent
    temperature; T is the temperature; w is the mixing ratio; L is the
    latent heat; and cp is the specific heat of air at constant
    pressure. 2. Adiabatic equivalent temperature; The temperature that
    an air parcel would have after undergoing the following (physically
    unrealizable) process: dry-adiabatic expansion until saturated;
    pseudoadiabatic expansion until all moisture is precipitated out;
    dry-adiabatic compression to the initial pressure. This is the
    equivalent temperature as read from a thermodynamic chart and is
    always greater than the isobaric equivalent temperature: Ta, e = T
    exp (Lw / cp T) where Ta, e is the adiabatic equivalent temperature.
    Also called pseudoequivalent temperature.
