# Definition

Of a traveling plane wave at a single frequency, the velocity of an
equiphase surface along the wave normal. Also called phase speed, wave
speed, wave velocity. Thus, the component sin ( 2π/λ)(x - ct) represents
a wavelength λ traveling in the positive x- direction with phase
velocity c. This concept is to be distinguished from signal velocity,
group velocity, and the velocity of fluid parcels. See velocity of
propagation.
