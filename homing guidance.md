# Definition

Guidance in which a craft or missile is directed toward a destination by
means of information received from the destination. It is active homing
guidance if the information received is in response to transmissions
from the craft, semiactive homing guidance if in response to
transmissions from a source other than the craft, and passive homing
guidance if natural radiations from the destination are utilized.
