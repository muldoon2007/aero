# Definition

1.  The relative mean molecular velocity of a selected gas undergoing
    diffusion in a gaseous atmosphere, commonly taken as a nitrogen (N2)
    atmosphere. The diffusion velocity is a molecular phenomenon and
    depends upon the gaseous concentration as well as upon the pressure
    and temperature gradients present. 2. The velocity or speed with
    which a turbulent diffusion process proceeds as evidenced by the
    motion of individual eddies.
