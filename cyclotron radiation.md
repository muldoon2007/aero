# Definition

The electromagnetic radiation emitted by charged particles as they orbit
in a magnetic field. The radiation arises from the centripetal
acceleration of the particle as it moves in a circular orbit. See Larmor
orbit. When the velocity is small, the radiation is concentrated in a
single spectral line, at the cyclotron frequency. The spectral line is
spread into a band of frequencies, however, from the effects of Doppler,
Stark, and collision broadening. In addition, as the speed of the
particles approaches the velocity of light, higher harmonics of the
cyclotron radiation occur at multiples of the cyclotron frequency.
