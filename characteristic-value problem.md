# Definition

A problem in which an undetermined parameter is involved in the
coefficients of a differential equation, and in which the solution of
the differential equation, with associated boundary conditions, exists
only for certain discrete values of the parameter, called eigenvalues,
or characteristic values, sometimes principal values. An important
example of a physical problem which leads to a characteristic-value
problem is the determination of the modes and frequencies of a vibrating
system. In this case the dependent variable of the differential equation
represents the displacements of the system and the parameter represents
the frequencies of vibration.
