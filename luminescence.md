# Definition

Light emission by a process in which kinetic heat energy is not
essential for the mechanism of excitation. Electroluminescence is
luminescence from electrical discharges - such as sparks or arcs.
Excitation in these cases results mostly from electron or ion collision
by which the kinetic energy of electrons or ions, accelerated in an
electric field, is given up to the atoms or molecules of the gas present
and causes light emission. Chemiluminescence results when energy, set
free in a chemical reaction, is converted to light energy. The light
from many chemical reactions and from many flames is of this type.
Photoluminescence, or fluorescence, results from excitation by
absorption of light. The term phosphorescence is usually applied to
luminescence which continues after excitation by one of the above
methods has ceased. Compare incandescence.
