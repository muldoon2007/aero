# Definition

Electromagnetic radiation lying within the wavelength interval to which
the human eye is sensitive, the spectral interval from approximately 0.4
to 0.7 micron (4000 to 7000 angstroms). The term is without reference to
the variable response of the human eye in its reception of radiation.
