# Definition

The complete set of stress components in a solid or fluid medium, which
are written as a tensor Ï„ij. It has nine components, one for each of the
coordinate faces of an imaginary element upon which the stress acts ( j
= x, y, z ) and for each direction in which the stress is directed ( i =
x, y, z ). By definition, an inviscid fluid is one in which the six
tangential stresses (i +/- j) are zero, and the three normal stresses (i
= j) are equal to the negative of the pressure.
