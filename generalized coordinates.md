# Definition

Any set of coordinates specifying the state of the system under
consideration. Usually employed in problems involving a finite number of
degrees of freedom, the generalized coordinates are chosen so as to take
advantage of the constraints of the system in reducing the total number
of coordinates. Also called Lagrangian coordinates.
