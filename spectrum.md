1.  In physics, any series of energies arranged according to wavelength
    (or frequency). 2. The series of images produced when a beam of
    radiant energy is subject to dispersion. 3. Short for
    electromagnetic spectrum or for any part of it used for a specific
    purpose as the radio spectrum (10 kilocycles to 300,000
    megacycles). 4. In mathematics, = function. 5. In acoustics, the
    distribution of effective sound pressures or intensities measured as
