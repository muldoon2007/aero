# Definition

Joining metals by flowing a thin-layer capillary thickness of nonferrous
filler metal into the space between them. Bonding results from the
intimate contact produced by the dissolution of a small amount of base
metal in the molten filler metal, without fusion of the base metal.
Sometimes, the filler metal is put in place as a thin solid sheet or as
cladding and the composite is heated as in furnace brazing. The term
brazing is used where the temperature exceeds some arbitrary value, such
as 800ï¿½F; the term soldering is used for temperatures lower than the
arbitrary value.
