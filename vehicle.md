# Definition

Specifically, a structure, machine, or device, such as an aircraft or
rocket, designed to carry a burden through air or space; more
restrictively, a rocket vehicle. This word has acquired its specific
meaning owing to the need for a term to embrace aircraft, rockets, and
all other flying craft, and has more currency than other words used in
this meaning. See launch vehicle.
