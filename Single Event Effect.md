- Single Event Effects (SEEs) are caused by a single, energetic particle, and 
  can take on many forms.  Single Event Upsets (SEUs) are soft errors, and 
  non-destructive.  They normally appear as transient pulses in logic or 
  support circuitry, or as bitflips in memory cells or registers.  Several 
  types of hard errors, potentially destructive, can appear:  Single 
  Event Latchup (SEL) results in a high operating current, above device 
  specifications, and must be cleared by a power reset.  Other hard errors 
  include Burnout of power MOSFETS, Gate Rupture, frozen bits, and noise 
  in CCDs.
