# Definition

1.  The process by which radiant energy is absorbed and converted into
    other forms of energy. See attenuation. Absorption takes place only
    after the radiant flux enters a medium and thus acts only on the
    entering flux not on the incident flux, some of which may be
    reflected at the surface of the medium. A substance which absorbs
    energy may also be a medium of refraction, diffraction, or
    scattering; these processes, however, involve no energy retention or
    transformation and are to be clearly differentiated from
    absorption. 2. In general, the taking up or assimilation of one
    substance by another. See sorption, adsorption. 3. In vacuum
    technology, gas entering into the interior of a solid.
