# Definition

An oval feature in the visible cloud surface of Jupiter, at latitude 20
to 25 degrees S. It is about 25,000 miles long in the planet's east-west
direction, and about 7000 miles wide in the north-south direction. It is
often reddish in color, but may be white or grey, or nearly invisible
compared to its surroundings. See South Tropical Disturbance. The
neighboring cloud matter seems to pass around it on the northern side,
producing the so-called Red Spot Hollow, by which it may be detected
even when the spot itself is invisible. Its rotation period averages 9
hours, 55 minutes, 38 seconds (very nearly the same as the rest of the
planet), but varies enough so that through the years since its discovery
in 1878 it has made more than one complete revolution with respect to
the underlying planet.
