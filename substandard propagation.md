# Definition

The propagation of radio energy under conditions of substandard
refraction in the atmosphere, that is, refraction by an atmosphere or
section of the atmosphere in which the index of refraction decreases
with height at a rate of less than 12 N-units per 1000 feet. See
standard propagation, superstandard propagation. Substandard propagation
produces a less-than-normal downward bending or even an upward bending
of radio waves as they travel through the atmosphere, giving closer
radio horizons and decreased radar and radio coverage. It results
primarily when propagation takes place through a layer in which moisture
remains constant or increases with height.
