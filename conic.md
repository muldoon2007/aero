# Definition

1.  A curve formed by the intersection of a plane and a right circular
    cone. Originally called conic section. The conic sections are the
    ellipse, the parabola, and the hyperbola, curves that are used to
    describe the path or bodies moving in space. The circle is a special
    case of the ellipse, an ellipse with an eccentricity of zero. The
    conic is the locus of all points the ratio of whose distances from a
    fixed point, called the focus, and a fixed line, called the
    directrix, is constant. 2. In reference to satellite orbital
    parameters, without consideration of the perturbing effects of the
    actual shape or distribution of mass of the primary. Thus, conic
    perigee is the perigee the satellite would have if all the mass of
    the primary were concentrated at its center.
