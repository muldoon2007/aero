# Definition

The total luminous flux received on a unit area of a given real or
imaginary surface, expressed in such units as the footcandle, lux, or
phot. Illuminance is analogous to irradiance, but is to be distinguished
from the latter in that illuminance refers only to light and contains
the luminous efficiency weighting factor necessitated by the nonlinear
wavelength-response of the human eye. Compare luminous intensity. The
only difference between illuminance and illumination is that the latter
always refers to light incident upon a material surface. A distinction
should be drawn, as well, between illuminance and luminance. The latter
is a measure of the light coming from a surface; thus, for a surface
which is not self-luminance, luminance is entirely dependent upon the
illuminance upon that surface and its reflection properties.
