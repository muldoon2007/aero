# Definition

That orbital point nearest the earth when the earth is the center of
attraction. See orbit. That orbital point farthest from the earth is
called apogee. Perigee and apogee are used by some writers in referring
to orbits of satellites, especially artificial satellites, around any
planet or satellite, thus avoiding coinage of new terms for each planet
and moon.
