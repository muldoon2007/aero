# Definition

A system of three angles which uniquely define with reference to one
coordinate system (e.g., earth axes), the orientation of a second
coordinate system (e.g., body axes). Any orientation of the second
system is obtainable from that of the first by rotation through each of
the three angles in turn, the sequence of which is important.
