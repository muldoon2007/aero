# Definition

Longitude on the earth; the arc of a parallel, or the angle at the pole,
between the prime meridian and the meridian of a point on the earth. See
coordinate, table VI. Terrestrial longitude is named for the datum used
to measure it. Astronomical longitude is the angle between the plane of
the reference meridian and the plane of the celestial meridian. Geodetic
longitude is the angle between the plane of the reference meridian and
the plane through the polar axis and the normal to the spheroid.
Geodetic and sometimes astronomical longitude are also called geographic
longitude. Geodetic longitude is used for charts.
