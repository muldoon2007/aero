# Definition

The representation of a function f(x) in an interval (-L, L) by a series
consisting of sines and cosines with a common period 2L, in the form,
where the Fourier coefficients are defined as and When f(x) is an even
function, only the cosine terms appear; when f(x) is odd, only the sine
terms appear. The conditions on f(x) guaranteeing convergence of the
series are quite general, and the series may serve as a root-mean-square
approximation even when it does not converge. If the function is defined
on an infinite interval and is not periodic, it is represented by the
Fourier integral. By either representation, the function is decomposed
into periodic components whose frequencies constitute the spectrum of
the function. The Fourier series employs a discrete spectrum of
wavelengths 2 L / n(n = 1,2,â€¦); the Fourier integral requires a
continuous spectrum. See Fourier transform.
