# Definition

1.  A place of access to a system where energy may be supplied or
    withdrawn or where system variables may be observed or measured. In
    any particular case, the ports are determined by the way in which
    the system is used, and not by the structure alone. A designated
    pair of terminals is an example of a port. 2. An opening, as the
    port in a solid rocket.
