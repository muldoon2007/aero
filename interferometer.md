# Definition

An apparatus used to produce and measure interference from two or more
coherent wave trains from the same source. See radio interferometer.
Interferometers are used to measure wavelengths, to measure angular
width of sources, to determine the angular position of sources (as in
satellite tracking), and for many other purposes.
