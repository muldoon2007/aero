# Definition

1.  Any device introduced into the atmosphere for producing an
    appreciable radar echo, usually for tracking some airborne device or
    as a tracer of wind. 2. A World War II code name for a type of
    radar-jamming device employed to confuse the operators of enemy
    radars (also referred to by the code names of rope, chaff , and
    clutter ). One type of window consists of packages containing
    thousands of small strips of paperbacked tinfoil which may be
    dropped from aircraft and balloons, ejected from rockets, and
    carried within balloons. The packages burst open upon ejection,
    scattering the tinfoil widely, producing a radar echo which looks
    like a small shower or a tight formation of aircraft on
    plan-position-indicator scopes. 3. Any gap in a linear continuum, as
    atmospheric windows , ranges of wavelengths in the electromagnetic
    spectrum to which the atmosphere is transparent, or firing windows ,
    intervals of time during which conditions are favorable for
    launching a spacecraft on a specific mission.
