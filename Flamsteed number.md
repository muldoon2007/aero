# Definition

A number sometimes used with the possessive form of the Latin name of
the constellation to identify a star, as 72 Ophiuchi. The Flamsteed
number is used for stars numbered in Flamsteed's British Catalogue of
1725. For stars which do not appear in Flamsteed's catalog, numbers from
other catalogs are used. See Bayer letter.
