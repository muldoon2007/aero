# Definition

Nonnuclear electromagnetic radiation of very short wavelength, lying
within the interval of 0.1 to 100 angstroms (between gamma rays and
ultraviolet radiation). Also called X-radiation, Roentgen ray . X-rays
penetrate various thickness of all solids and they act upon photographic
plates in the same manner as light. Secondary X-rays are produced
whenever X-rays are absorbed by a substance; in the case of absorption
by a gas, this results in ionization.
