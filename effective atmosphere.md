# Definition

1.  That part of the atmosphere which effectively influences a
    particular process or motion, its outer limits varying according to
    the terms of the process or motion considered. For example, an earth
    satellite orbiting at 250 miles altitude remains within the
    ionosphere, but because the air particles are so sparse at this
    altitude as to cause no appreciable friction of deflection, the
    satellite may be considered to be outside the effective atmosphere.
    For movement of air vehicles the effective atmosphere ends at the
    aeropause (which see). 2. = optically effective atmosphere.
