# Definition

A numerical system in which each decimal digit is represented by a pair
of digits consisting of a coefficient of five followed by a coefficient
of one. For example, the decimal digit 7 is represented in biquinary
notation by 12 \[(1 x 5) + (2 x 1)\], and the decimal quantity 3648 is
represented by 03 11 04 13. The abacus is based on biquinary notation.
