# Definition

The common logarithm of opacity. Hence, film transmitting 100 percent of
the light has a density of zero, transmitting 10 percent, a density of
1, etc. Density may be diffuse, specular, or intermediate. Conditions
must be specified. Also called optical density. Diffuse transmission
density is the value of the photographic transmission density obtained
when the light flux impinges normally on the sample and all the
transmitted flux is collected and measured. Specular transmission
density is the value of the photographic density obtained when the light
flux impinges normally on the sample and only the normal component of
the transmitted flux is collected and measured.
