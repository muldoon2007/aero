# Definition

An idealized reversible heat engine working in a Carnot cycle. It is the
most efficient engine that can operate between two specified
temperatures; its efficiency is equivalent to the thermodynamic
efficiency. The Carnot engine is capable of being run either as a
conventional engine or as a refrigerator.
