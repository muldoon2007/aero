# Definition

The difference between the mean velocity of fluid flow and the
instantaneous velocity at a point. For example u' = u - , where u' is
the eddy velocity; u is the instantaneous velocity; and is mean
velocity. Also called fluctuation velocity. Over the same interval which
defines the mean velocity, the average value of the eddy velocity is
necessarily zero.
