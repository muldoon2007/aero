# Definition

A coefficient defined as the ratio of the dynamic viscosity of a fluid
to its density. The kinematic viscosity of most gases increases with
increasing temperature and decreasing pressure. For dry air at 0 degrees
C, the kinematic viscosity is about 0.13 square centimeter per second.
In the theory of atmospheric turbulence the kinematic viscosity is
usually replaced by the kinematic eddy viscosity to account for the
increased internal friction due to turbulence.
