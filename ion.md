# Definition

1.  A charged atom or molecularly bound group of atoms; sometimes also a
    free electron or other charged subatomic particle. An ion pair
    consists of a positive ion and a negative ion (usually an electron)
    having charges of the same magnitude and formed from a neutral atom
    or molecule by the action of radiation. In spectroscopy, the degree
    of ionization of an atom is indicated by a Roman numeral following
    the symbol for the element. An un-ionized atom is indicated by the
    Roman numeral I, a singly ionized atom, one which has lost one
    electron, is indicated by II, and so on. Thus Fe IX indicates the
    spectrum of an iron atom which has lost eight electrons. 2. In
    atmospheric electricity, any of several types of electrically charge
    submicroscopic particles normally found in the atmosphere.
    Atmospheric ions are of two principle types, small ions and large
    ions, although a class of intermediate ions has occasionally been
    reported. The ionization process which forms small ions depends upon
    two distinct agencies, cosmic rays and radioactive emanations. Each
    of these consists of very energetic particles which ionize neutral
    air molecules by knocking out one or more planetary electrons. The
    resulting free electron and positively charged molecule (or atom)
    very quickly attach themselves to one or, at most, a small number of
    neutral air molecules, thereby forming new small ions. In the
    presence of Aitken nuclei, some the small ions will in turn attach
    themselves to these nuclei, thereby creating new large ions. The two
    main classes of ions differ widely in mobility. Only the highly
    mobile small ions contribute significantly to the electrical
    conductivity of the air under most conditions. The intermediate ions
    and large ions are important in certain space charge effects, but
    are too sluggish to contribute much to conductivity. The processes
    of formation of ions are offset by certain processes of destruction
    of the ions (see recombination). 3. In chemistry, atoms or specific
    groupings of atoms which have gained or lost one or more electrons,
    as the chloride ion or ammonium ion. Such ions exist in aqueous
    solutions and in certain crystal structures.
