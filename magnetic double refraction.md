# Definition

The splitting, into two components, of a radio wave traveling in a
region of free electrons. This is due to the interaction of the earth's
magnetic field and the alternating field of the radio wave. Except for
waves near the gyrofrequency, the components of the split wave, the
ordinary ray and the extraordinary ray, will travel with slightly
different velocities and be reflected at different heights. See
magneto-ionic theory.
