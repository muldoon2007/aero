# Definition

The passage of gas through a connection between two vessels at different
temperatures resulting in a pressure gradient when equilibrium is
reached. Under conditions of molecular flow the equilibrium condition is
expressed by where pa and Ta are the pressure and absolute temperature,
respectively, in one vessel and pb and Tb are the pressure and absolute
temperature, respectively, in the other.
