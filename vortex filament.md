# Definition

A line along which an infinite vorticity in a fluid motion is
concentrated, the surrounding fluid being free of vorticity. In an
autobarotropic frictionless fluid, a vortex line always consists of the
same fluid particles; the vortex filament is, thus, a vortex line and is
the limiting case of a vortex tube as the cross-sectional area of the
tube shrinks to zero.
