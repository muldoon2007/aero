# Definition

1.  A thin and more-or-less flat object intended to align itself with a
    stream or flow in a manner similar to that of the common
    weathercock, as: (a) a device that project ahead of an aircraft to
    sense gusts or other actions of the air so as to create impulses or
    signals that are transmitted to the control system to stabilize the
    aircraft; (b) a fixed or movable surface used to control or give
    stability to a rocket. See control vane. 2. A blade or paddle-like
    object, often fashioned like an airfoil and usually one of several,
    that rotates about an axis, either being moved by a flow or creating
    a flow itself, such as the blade of a turbine, of a fan, of a rotary
    pump or air compressor, etc. See impeller vane. 3. Any of certain
    stationary blades, plates, or the like that serve to guide or direct
    a flow, or to create a special kind of flow, as: (a) any of the
    blades in the nozzle ring of a gas-turbine engine; (b) any of the
    plates or slatlike objects that guide the flow in a wind tunnel; (c)
    a plate or fence projecting from a wing to prevent spanwise flow.
    See contravane. See airfoil, note.
