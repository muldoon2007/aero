# Definition

In radar, a display in which a target appears as a complete circle when
the radar antenna is correctly pointed at it and in which the radius of
the circle is proportional to target distance. When not correctly
pointing at the target, the circle reduces to a segment of a circle, the
segment length being inversely proportional to the magnitude of the
pointing error and its angular position being reciprocal to the
direction of pointing error. Also called I-scan, I-scope, I-indicator.
