# Definition

A thermonuclear reaction in which two protons collide at very high
velocities and combine to form a deuteron. The resultant deuteron may
capture another proton to form tritium and the latter may undergo proton
capture to form helium. Compare carbon cycle. The proton-proton reaction
is now believed to be the principal source of energy within the sun and
other stars of its class. A temperature of the order of 5 million
degrees Kelvin and high hydrogen (proton) concentrations are required
for this reaction to proceed at rates compatible with energy emission by
such stars.
