# Definition

The study of the phenomena arising out of the motion of a solid through
a gas at speeds high enough to cause ablation; for example, the
interaction of a meteoroid with the atmosphere. Astroballistics uses the
data and methods of astronomy, aerodynamics, ballistics, and physical
chemistry.
