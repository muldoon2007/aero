# Definition

The duration of one rotation of the earth on its axis, with respect to
the vernal equinox. It is measured by successive transits of the vernal
equinox over the upper branch of a meridian. Because of the precession
of the equinoxes, the sidereal day thus defined is slightly less than
the period of rotation with respect to the stars, but the difference is
less than 0.01 second. The length of the mean sidereal day is 24 hours
of sidereal time or 23 hours 56 minutes 4.09054 seconds of mean solar
time.
