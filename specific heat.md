# Definition

The ratio of the heat absorbed (or released) by unit mass of a system to
the corresponding temperature rise (or fall). If this ratio varies with
temperature, it must be defined as a differential quotient dQ/dT, where
dQ is the infinitesimal increment of heat per unit mass and dT is the
infinitesimal increment of temperature. For gases the thermodynamic
process must be specified; two specific heats are defined, one being the
specific heat in a constant-pressure process cp = (dQ / dT)p and the
other, the specific heat in a constant-volume process cv = (dQ / dT)v In
a perfect gas these are, by definition, constants with respect to
temperature, and the difference of the specific heat at constant
pressure and the specific heat at constant volume is equal to the gas
constant: R = cp - cv
