# Definition

1.  The partial derivative of any physical variable with respect to
    temperature, when the value of the variable decreases as temperature
    increases. 2. The decrease in reactivity of a nuclear reactor with
    increase in temperature. Increasing temperature within the reactor
    increases the average neutron energy. Since the cross section of the
    fissionable material decrease with increased neutron energy, the net
    effect of increased temperature is to decrease the number of
    fissions.
