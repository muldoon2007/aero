# Definition

The Doppler effect applied to a source of light. When the distance
between the observer and the source of light is diminishing, the lines
of the spectrum are displaced toward the violet, and, when the distance
is increasing, they are displace toward the red, the displacement being
proportional to the relative velocity of approach or recession.
