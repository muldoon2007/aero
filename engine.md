## Open

-   Examples: [aero/Tap-off cycle](Tap-off cycle.org) and gas generator
-   Some propellant used to power the [aero/Turbopump](Turbopump.org),
    then exhaused
-   Simpler

## Closed (Staged)

-   No exhaust is discarded, everything goes to the primary combustion
    chamber
-   Pre-burner powers the turbopumps
-   Higher efficiency, less waste, more engineering complexity
-   Can be ox-rich, fuel-rich, or full flow

### Full flow

-   Requires two preburners, one ox-rich, the other fuel-rich
-   Exhaust from both preburners is combined to have the right mixture
-   SpaceX Raptor is the only one ever developed to test
