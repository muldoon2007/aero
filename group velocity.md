# Definition

The velocity of a wave disturbance as a whole, i.e., of an entire group
of component simple harmonic waves. The group velocity U is related to
the phase speed c of the individual harmonic waves of length l by the
frequency equation U = c - l ( dc / dl ). The phase speed c is thus
equal to the group velocity only in the case of nondispersive waves,
i.e., when dc/dl = 0. See velocity of propagation.
