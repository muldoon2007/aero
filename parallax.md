# Definition

The difference in the apparent direction or position of an object when
viewed from different points expressed as an angle. For bodies of the
solar system, parallax is measured from the surface of the earth and its
center and is called geocentric parallax, varying with the body's
altitude and distance form the earth. The geocentric parallax when a
body is in the horizon is called horizontal parallax and is the angular
semidiameter of the earth as seen from the body. Parallax of the moon is
called lunar parallex. For stars, parallax is measured from the earth
and the sun, and is called annual, heliocentric, or stellar parallax.
Compare aberration.
