# Definition

A quantum of electromagnetic radiation emitted by a nucleus, each such
photon being emitted as the result of a quantum transition between two
energy levels of the nucleus. Gamma rays have energies usually between
10 thousand electron volts and 10 million electron volts with
correspondingly short wavelengths and high frequencies. Also called
gamma radiation. X-rays occur in the same energy range as gamma rays but
are of nonnuclear origin. In atmospheric electricity, gamma rays are of
some importance in contributing to atmospheric ionization, along with
alpha particles and beta particles. Gamma ray photons have much greater
penetration ranges than do alpha and beta particles, often amounting to
distances of the order of a hundred meters in air at sea level. These
high-energy photons may initiate their ionizing action by ejecting
photoelectrons from neutral atoms or molecules of the air, by ejecting
electrons by the Compton effect, or (for gamma photons with energies
above a few million electron volts) by pair production in which an
electron and a positron are created.
