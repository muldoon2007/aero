# Definition

1.  = speed. See note. 2. A vector quantity equal to speed in a given
    direction. In sense 1, velocity is often used synonymously with
    speed, as in the velocity of the airplane, but in such contexts
    speed is properly the preferred term; except in the compound
    airspeed, velocity is preferred to speed in reference to motion of
    air or other fluid.
