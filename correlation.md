# Definition

1.  In statistics, a relationship between two occurrences which is
    expressed as number between minus one (-1) and plus one (+1). 2.
    When used without further qualification, the statistical term
    correlation usually refers to simple, linear correlation between two
    variables x and y and is measured by the product-moment coefficient
    of correlation or its sample estimate r defined as follows, where
    the respective population mean values of x and y are denoted by and
    , the respective standard deviations by ( x ) and ( y ), and where E
    is the expected value: The product-moment E\[(x - )(y - )\] is
    usually called the covariance of x and y. See autocorrelation,
    multiple correlation, partial correlation. In connection with
    correlation, the word simple is used in contradistinction to other
    qualifiers such as multiple or partial. The word linear refers to a
    linear relationship between the two variables, or more precisely, to
    a linear approximation of the regression function of either variable
    with respect to the other.
