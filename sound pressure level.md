# Definition

In decibels, 20 times the logarithm to the base 10 of the ratio of the
sound pressure to the reference pressure. The reference pressure must be
explicitly stated. The following reference pressures are in common use:
(a) 2 X 10E-4 microbar, (b) 1 microbar. Reference pressure (a) is in
general use for measurements concerned with hearing and with sound in
air and liquids, whereas (b) has gained widespread acceptance for
calibration of transducers and various kinds of sound measurements in
liquids. Unless otherwise explicitly stated, it is to be understood that
the sound pressure is the effective (root-mean-square) sound pressure.
It is to be noted that in many sound fields the sound pressure ratios
are not the square roots of the corresponding power ratios.
