# Definition

That type of gaseous electrical discharge in which the charge transfer
occurs intermittently along a relatively constricted path of high ion
density, resulting in high luminosity. It is of short duration and to be
contrasted with the nonluminous point discharge, with the diffuse corona
discharge, and also with the continuous arc discharge. The exact meaning
to be attached to the term spark discharge varies somewhat in the
literature. It is frequently applied to just the transient phase of the
establishment of any arc discharge. A lightning discharge is a
large-scale spark discharge, though its very length introduces certain
details not found in laboratory short-spark processes.
