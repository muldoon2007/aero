# Definition

1.  The brief and rapid movement of air or other fluid away from a
    center of outward pressure, as in an explosion. 2. The
    characteristic instantaneous rise in pressure, followed by a sudden
    decrease, that results from this movement, differentiated from less
    rapid pressure changes. 3. To take off from a launching pad or
    stand. Said of a rocket in reference to the blast effects caused by
    rapid combustion of fuel as the rocket starts to move upward.
    (Popular). This term is commonly used for explosion, but the two
    terms should be distinguished. In space, an explosion could take
    place, but no blast would follow.
