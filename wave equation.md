# Definition

The partial differential equation of the form where is usually a
function of the position and time coordinates; 2 is the Laplacian
operator; t is the time; and C2 is a constant. Also called equation of
wave motion . See wave, gravity wave. The general solution to this
equation is any function defined over a plane, the phase front, moving
perpendicular to itself at the speed c.
