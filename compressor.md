# Definition

A machine for compressing air or other fluid. Compressors are
distinguished (1) by the manner in which fluid is handled or compressed,
as the axial flow, centrifugal, double-entry, free-vortex, mixed-flow,
single-entry, and supersonic compressor; or (2) by the number of stages,
as the multistage or single-stage compressor. See individual entries on
the different types.
