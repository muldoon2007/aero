# Definition

A prescribed method of design for obtaining minimum zero-lift drag for a
given aerodynamic configuration, such as a wing-body configuration, at a
given speed. For a transonic body, the area rule is applied by
subtracting from, or adding to, its cross-sectional area distribution
normal to the air stream at various stations so as to make its
cross-sectional area distribution approach that of an ideal body of
minimum drag; for a supersonic body, the sectional areas are frontal
projections of areas intercepted by planes inclined at the Mach angle.
