# Definition

An increase in the effective ionization rate of a gas due to the
presence of a small number of foreign metastable atoms. For instance, a
neon atom has a metastable level at 16.6 volts and if there are a few
neon atoms in a gas of argon which has an ionization potential of 15.7
volts, a collision between the neon metastable atom with an argon atom
may lead to ionization of the argon. Thus, the energy which is stored in
the metastable atom can be used to increase the ionization rate. Other
gases where this effect is used are helium, with a metastable level at
19.8 volts, and mercury, with an ionization level at 10.4 volts.
