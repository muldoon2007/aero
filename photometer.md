# Definition

An instrument for measuring the intensity of light or the relative
intensity of a pair of lights. Also called illuminometer. If the
instrument is designed to measure the intensity of light as a function
of wavelength, it is called a spectrophotometer. Photometers may be
divided into two classes: photoelectric photometers in which a
photoelectric cell is used to compare electrically the intensity of an
unknown light with that of a standard light, and visual photometers in
which the human eye is the sensor.
