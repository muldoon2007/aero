# Definition

(From barometric switch). 1. Specifically, a pressure-operated switching
device used in a radiosonde. In operation, the expansion of an aneroid
capsule causes an electrical contact to scan a radiosonde commutator
composed of conductors separated by insulators. Each switching operation
corresponds to a particular pressure level. The contact of an insulator
or a conductor determines whether temperature, humidity, or reference
signals will be transmitted. 2. Any switch operated by a change in
atmospheric pressure.
