# Definition

A general term indicating the magnitude of a pulse. For specific
designation, adjectives such as average, instantaneous, peak,
root-mean-square (effective), etc., should be used to indicate the
particular meaning intended. Pulse amplitude is measured with respect to
the normally constant value unless otherwise stated.
