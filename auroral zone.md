# Definition

A roughly circular band around either geomagnetic pole above which there
is a maximum of auroral activity. It lies about 10 to 15Â° of geomagnetic
latitude from the geomagentic poles. The auroral zone broadens and
extends equatorward during intense auroral displays. The northern
auroral zone is centered along a line passing near Point Barrow, Alaska,
through the lower half of Hudson Bay, slightly off the southern tip of
Greenland, through Iceland, northern Norway and northern Siberia. Along
this line auroras are seen on an average of 240 nights a year. The
frequency of auroras falls off both to the north and to the south of
this line but more rapidly to the south. The most severe blackouts occur
in the auroral zone.
