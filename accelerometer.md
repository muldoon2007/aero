# Definition

A transducer which measures acceleration or gravitational forces capable
of imparting acceleration. An accelerometer usually uses a concentrated
mass (seismic mass) which resists movement because of its inertia. The
displacement of the seismic mass relative to its supporting frame or
container is used as a measure of acceleration.
