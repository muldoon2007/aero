# Definition

The process in which the width of the lines in an emission spectrum or
absorption spectrum of a gaseous radiative medium is increased due to
perturbations of the energy states by collisions of the molecules or
atoms within the gas. The extent of this line-broadening effect is
directly proportional to the number of impacts experienced by the
emitter or absorber per unit time, and hence is proportional to the
pressure. Compare Doppler broadening.
