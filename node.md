# Definition

1.  One of the two points of intersection of the orbit of a planet,
    planetoid, or comet with the ecliptic, or of the orbit of a
    satellite with the plane of the orbit of its primary. Also called
    nodal point. See regression of the nodes. That point at which the
    body crosses to the north side of the reference plane is called the
    ascending node; the other, the descending node. The line connecting
    the nodes is called line of nodes. 2. A point, line, or surface in a
    standing wave where some characteristic of the wave field has
    essentially zero amplitude. The appropriate modifier should be used
    before the word node to signify the type that is intended; e.g.,
    displacement node, velocity node, pressure node. 3. A terminal of
    any branch of a network or a terminal common to two or more branches
    of a network. Also called junction point, branch point , or vertex.
