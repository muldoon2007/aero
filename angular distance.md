    the angle between two lines extending in the given directions. 2.
    The arc of the great circle joining two points, expressed in angular
    units. 3. Distance between two points, expressed in wave lengths at
    a specified frequency. It is equal to the number of waves between
    the points multiplied by if expressed in radians, or multiplied by
    360Â° if measured in degrees.
