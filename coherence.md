# Definition

In radar, a relation between two wave trains such that, when they are
brought into coincidence, they are capable of producing interpretable
interference phenomena. This is limited to those wave trains which have
fixed or slowly varying phase relationships with each other. In contract
are the rapid interference phenomena produced by the superposition of
the more or less randomly scattered waves from hydrometeors.
