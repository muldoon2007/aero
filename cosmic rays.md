# Definition

The aggregate of extremely high energy subatomic particles which travel
the solar system and bombard the earth from all directions. Cosmic-ray
primaries seem to be mostly protons, hydrogen nuclei, but also contain
heavier nuclei. On colliding with atmospheric particles they produce
many different kinds of lower energy secondary cosmic radiation (see
cascade shower). Also called cosmic radiation. Cosmic rays thought to
originate outside the solar system are called galactic cosmic rays.
Those thought to originate in the sun are called solar cosmic rays. In
the earth's atmosphere, the maximum flux of cosmic rays, both primary
and secondary, is at an altitude of 20 km, and below this the absorption
of the atmosphere reduces the flux, though the rays are still readily
detectable at sea level. Intensity of cosmic-ray showers has also been
observed to vary with latitude, being more intense at the poles. See
cosmic-ray knee, corpuscular cosmic rays.
