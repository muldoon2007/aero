# Definition

1.  In rocketry (a) deviation from a prescribed flight path, (b)
    specifically, circular dispersion. 2. A measure of the scatter of
    data points around a mean value or around a regression curve.
    Usually expressed as a standard-deviation estimate, or as a standard
    error of estimate. Note that the scatter is not centered around the
    true value unless systematic errors are zero. 3. The process in
    which radiation is separated into its component wavelengths.
    Dispersion results when an optical process, such as diffraction,
    refraction, or scattering, varies according to wavelength. 4. In
    spectroscopy, a measure of the resolving power of a spectroscope or
    spectrograph, usually expressed in angstroms per millimeter. 5. As
    applied to materials, a scattering of very fine particles (e.g.,
    ceramics) within the body of a metallic material usually resulting
    in overall strengthening of the composite material.
