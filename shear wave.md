# Definition

A wave in an elastic medium which causes an element of the medium to
change its shape without a change of volume. Mathematically, a shear
wave is one whose velocity field has zero divergence. Also called
rotational wave. A shear plane wave in an isotropic medium is called a
transverse wave.
