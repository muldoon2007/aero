# Definition

In meteorology, an expression relating all forms of energy obtained by
combining the thermodynamic energy equation with the mechanical energy
equation. This equation expresses the fact that the combined internal,
kinetic, and potential energy in a given volume of the atmosphere can
vary only as a result of: (a) the transport of these forms of energy
across the boundaries of the volume; (b) the work done by pressure
forces on the boundary; (c) the addition or removal of heat; and (d) the
dissipational effect of friction.
