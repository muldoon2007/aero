# Definition

The radiation law which states that at a given temperature the ratio of
the emissivity to the absorptivity for a given wavelength is the same
for all bodies and is equal to the emissivity of an ideal black body at
that temperature and wavelength. Loosely put, this important law asserts
that good absorbers of a given wavelength are also good emitters of that
wavelength. It is essential to note that the Kirchhoff law relates
absorption and emission at the same wavelength and at the same
temperature. Also called Kirchhoff radiation law.
