# Definition

The conical motion of the earth's axis about the normal to the plane of
the ecliptic, caused by the attractive force of the sun, moon, and other
planets on the equatorial protuberance of the earth. The effect of the
sun and moon, called lunisolar precession, is to produce a westward
motion of the equinoxes along the ecliptic. The effect of other planets,
called planetary precession, tends to produce a much smaller motion
eastward along the ecliptic. The resultant motion, called general
precession, is westward along the ecliptic at the rate of about 50.3
seconds of arc per year. The component of general precession along the
celestial equator, called precession in right ascension, is about 46.1
seconds of arc per year; and the component along a celestial meridian,
called precession in declination, is about 20.0 seconds of arc per year.
