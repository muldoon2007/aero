# Definition

In gaseous electric conduction, the average velocity with which a given
ion drifts through a specified gas under the influence of an electric
field of unit strength. Mobility's are commonly expressed in units of
centimeters per second per volt per centimeter. Also called ionic
mobility. In a vacuum, a single gaseous ion subjected to any nonzero
potential gradient would accelerate indefinitely; but in the midst of a
gas the ion continually experiences collisions with gas molecules. These
encounters tend to break up its trajectory into a series of short
intervals of acceleration punctuated by deflections. The net result is
that the ion's gross motion resembles drift at a uniform velocity. The
mobility depends not only upon the nature of the ion and gas but also
upon the density of the gas, for the latter controls the mean free path
of the ion.
