1.  The expansion or spreading out of a vector field; also a precise
    measure thereof. In mathematical discussion divergence is considered
    to include convergence, i.e., negative divergence. 2. A static
    instability of a lifting surface or of a body on a vehicle wherein
    the aerodynamic loads tending to deform the surface or body are
    greater than the elastic restoring forces.
