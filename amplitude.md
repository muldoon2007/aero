# Definition

1.  The maximum value of the displacement of a wave or other periodic
    phenomenon from a reference position. 2. Angular distance north or
    south of the prime vertical; the arc of the horizon, or the angle at
    the zenith between the prime vertical and a vertical circle,
    measured north or south from the prime vertical to the vertical
    circle. The term is customarily used only with reference to bodies
    whose centers are on the celestial horizon, and is prefixed E or W,
    as the body is rising or setting, respectively; and suffixed N or S
    to agree with the declination. The prefix indicates the origin, and
    the suffix indicates the direction of measurement. Amplitude is
    designated as true, magnetic, compass, or grid as the reference
    direction is true, magnetic, compass, or grid east or west,
    respectively.
