1.  In electricity, the factor by which the square of the instantaneous
    conduction current must be multiplied to obtain the power lost by
    heat dissipation or other permanent radiation of energy away from
    the electrical current. 2. In mechanics, the opposition by
    frictional effects to forces tending to produce motion.
