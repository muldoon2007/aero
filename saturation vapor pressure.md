# Definition

1.  The vapor pressure of a system, at a given temperature, wherein the
    vapor of a substance is in equilibrium with a plane surface of the
    pure liquid or solid phase of that substance; that is, the vapor
    pressure of a system that has attained saturation but not
    supersaturation. Compare equilibrium vapor pressure, vapor tension.
    The saturation vapor pressure of any pure substance, with respect to
    a specified parent phase, is an intrinsic property of that substance
    and is a function of temperature alone (see Clapeyron-Clausius
    equation). 2. = equilibrium vapor pressure.
