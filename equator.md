# Definition

The primary great circle of a sphere or spheroid, such as the earth,
perpendicular to the polar axis; or a line resembling or approximating
such a circle. The terrestrial equator is 90� from the earth's
geographical poles; the celestial equator or equinoctial is 90 � from
the celestial poles; the galactic equator or galactic circle is 90� from
the galactic poles. The astronomical equator is a line connecting points
having 0� astronomical latitude; the geodetic equator connects points
having 0� geodetic latitude. The expression terrestrial equator is
sometimes applied to the astronomical equator. The geodetic equator is
shown on charts. A fictitious equator is a reference line serving as the
origin for measurement of fictitious latitude. A transverse or inverse
equator is a meridian the plane of which is perpendicular to the axis of
a transverse projection. An oblique equator is a great circle the plane
of which is perpendicular to the axis of an oblique projection. A grid
equator is a line perpendicular to a prime grid meridian at the origin.
The magnetic equator or aclinic line is that line on the surface of the
earth connecting all points at which the magnetic dip is zero. The
geomagnetic equator is the great circle 90� from the geomagnetic poles
of the earth.
