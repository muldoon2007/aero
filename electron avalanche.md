# Definition

The process in which a relatively small number of free electrons in a
gas that is subjected to a strong electric field accelerate, ionize gas
atoms by collision, and thus form new free electrons to undergo the same
process in cumulative fashion. An avalanche cannot begin until the local
electric field strength is high enough to accelerate a free electron to
the minimum ionizing speed in the space and time interval corresponding
to one mean free path of the electron, for upon collision, the electron
usually loses its forward motion in the direction of the field.
