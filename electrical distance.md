# Definition

The distance between two points expressed in terms of the duration of
travel of an electromagnetic wave in free space between the two points.
A convenient unit of electrical distance is the light microsecond or
approximately 983 feet (300 meters). In the use of this unit, electrical
distance is numerically equal to transmission time in microseconds.
