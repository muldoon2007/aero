# Definition

The power generated per unit volume in a controlled thermonuclear
plasma. Using a deuterium reaction at a density of 1016 particles per
cubic centimeter and a temperature of 60,000 volts, the power density is
about 1000 watts per cubic centimeter. The energy comes off as kinetic
energy of the reaction products.
