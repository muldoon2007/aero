# Definition

Stars are classified by their spectra, designated by letters, sometimes
with numerical subdivisions, as the sun is a G1-type star. The seven
main types with their principal spectral characteristics are, in order
of decreasing temperature: O - He II absorption; B - He I absorption;
A - H absorption; F - Ca II absorption; G - strong metallic lines; K
-bands developing; M - very red. Also, the letters, P, W, Q, R, N, and S
are used to designate comparatively rare types of stars which do not
fall into the main series.
