# Definition

A relatively rare form of lightning, consisting of a reddish, luminous
ball, of the order of 1 foot in diameter, which may move rapidly along
solid objects or remain floating in midair. Hissing noises emanate from
such balls, and they sometimes explode nosily but may also disappear
noiselessly. Also called globe lightning . It has been suggested that
ball lightning is a temporarily stable plasma.
