# Definition

A hypothetical body whose surface absorbs no electromagnetic radiation
of any wavelength, i.e., one which exhibits zero absorptivity for all
wavelengths; an idealization exactly opposite to that of the black body.
See gray body. In nature, no true white bodies are known. Most white
pigments possessing high reflectivity for visible radiation are fairly
good absorbers in the infrared; hence, they are not white bodies in the
sense of the radiation theory. However, the term white body is used for
physical objects with respect to a particular wavelength interval.
