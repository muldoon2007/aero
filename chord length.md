# Definition

The length of the chord of an airfoil section between the extremities of
the section. For many airfoils, the chord is established intersecting
the airfoil profile at its extremities, and the chord length is equal to
the length of the chord between the points of intersection; for airfoils
where the chord is established by a point or points of tangency or
intersection not at the extremities, however, the chord length is
considered to extend beyond either or both points, as necessary, to
equal the maximum length of the profile. See chord, senses 2 and 3.
