# Definition

Any of those variables of a problem, chosen according to convenience,
which may arbitrarily be specified, and which then determine the other
or dependent variables of the problem. The independent variables are
often called the coordinates, particularly in problems involving motion
in space. Dependent and independent variables can be interchanges, e.g.,
height and pressure.
