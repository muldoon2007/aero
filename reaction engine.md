# Definition

An engine that develops thrust by its reaction to a substance ejected
from it; specifically, such an engine that elects a jet or stream of
gases created by the burning of fuel within the engine. Also called
reaction motor. A reaction engine operates in accordance with Newton
third law of motion, i.e., to every action (force) there is an equal and
opposite reaction. Both rocket engines and jet engines are reaction
engines.
