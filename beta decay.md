# Definition

Radioactive transformation of a nuclide in which the atomic number
changes by ï¿½1 with the emission of a beta particle and the mass number
remains unchanged. Also called beta disintegration . Increase of atomic
number occurs with negative beta particle emission, decrease with
positive beta particle (positron) emission or upon electron capture.
