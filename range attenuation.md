# Definition

In radar terminology, the decrease in power density (flux density)
caused by the divergence of the flux lines with distance, this decrease
being in accordance with the inverse-square law. For one-way
transmission, this attenuation is proportional to 1/RE2 where R is the
range from the transmitter. For a radar and a point target, the range
attenuation is proportional to 1/RE4, the transmission being two way.
