# Definition

A plate, series of plates, comb, tube, bar, or other device that
projects into the airstream about a body to break up or spoil the
smoothness of the flow, especially such a device that projects from the
upper surface of an airfoil, giving an increased drag and a decreased
lift. Compare deflector, sense (a). Spoilers are normally movable and
consist of two basic types: the flap spoiler, which is hinged along one
edge and lies flush with the airfoil or body when not in use, and the
retractable spoiler, which retracts edgewise into the body.
