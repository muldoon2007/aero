# Definition

A measure of power equal to one-half the Napierian logarithm (logarithm
to the base e ) of the power ratio. 1 neper is equal to 8.686 decibels.
Under certain conditions the neper is a measure of the ratio of
amplitudes of such physical quantities as voltage, current, particle
velocities, and sound pressure. The neper is not commonly used in
English-speaking countries.
