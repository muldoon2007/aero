# Definition

A mathematically defined thermodynamic function of state, the decrease
in which during a reversible isothermal process is equal to the work
done by the system. the Helmholtz function is a = u - Ts where u is
specific internal energy; T is Kelvin temperature; and s is specific
entropy. By use of the first law of thermodynamics for reversible
processes, da = -s dT - dw where dw is the work done per unit mass by
the system. Also called Helmhotlz free energy, work function. Compare
Gibbs function.
