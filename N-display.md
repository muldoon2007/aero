# Definition

In radar, a display similar to the K-display in which the target appears
as a pair of vertical deflections or blips from the horizontal time
base. Direction is indicated by the relative amplitude of the vertical
deflections; target distance is determined by moving an adjustable
signal along the baseline until it coincides with the horizontal
position of the vertical deflections. The horizontal control is
calibrated in distance. Also called N-scan, N-scope, N-indicator.
