# Definition

A two-dimensional radio navigation system using continuous-wave
transmission to provide hyperbolic lines of position through
radiofrequency phase comparison techniques from four transmitters. The
system is used for surveying or ship-positioning. Frequency band, 1.7 to
2.5 megacycles. Similar to Raydist system in principle.
