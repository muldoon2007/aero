1.  The ability of a film, a lens, a combination of both, or a vidicon
    system to render barely distinguishable a standard pattern of black
    and white lines. When the resolution is said to be 10 lines per
    millimeter, it means that the pattern whose line plus space width is
    0.1 millimeter is barely resolved, the finer patterns are not
    resolved, and the coarser patterns are more clearly resolved. In
    satellite television systems the limiting element is the television
    scanning pattern. 2. In radar, the minimum angular separation at the
    antenna at which two targets can be distinguished (a function of
    beamwidth); or the minimum range at which two targets at the same
    azimuth can be separated (equal to one-half the pulse length). 3. Of
    a gyro, a measure of response to small changes in input; the maximum
    value of the minimum input change that will cause a detectable
    change in the output for inputs greater than the threshold,
    expressed as a percent of one half the input range.
