# Definition

A very general principle applying to all forms of wave motion which
states that every point on the instantaneous position of an advancing
phase front (wave front) may be regarded as a source of secondary
spherical wavelets. The position of the phase front a moment later is
then determined as the envelope of all the secondary wavelets (ad
infinitum). This principle, stated by Dutch physicist Christian Huygens
(1629-95), is extremely useful in understanding effects due to
refraction, reflection, diffraction, and scattering of all types of
radiation, including sonic radiation as well as electromagnetic
radiation and applying even to ocean-wave propagation.
