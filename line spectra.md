# Definition

The spontaneous emission of electromagnetic radiation from the bound
electrons as they jump from high to low energy levels in an atom. This
radiation is essentially at a single frequency determined by the jump in
energy. Each different jump in energy level, therefore, has its own
frequency and the net radiation is referred to as the line spectra.
Since these line spectra are characteristic of the atom, they can be
used for identification purposes.
