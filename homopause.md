# Definition

The top of the homosphere, or the level of transition between it and the
heterosphere. See atmospheric shell. The homopause probably lies between
80 and 90 kilometers, where molecular oxygen begins to dissociate into
atomic oxygen. The homopause is somewhat lower in the daytime than at
night.
