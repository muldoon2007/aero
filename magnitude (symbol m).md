# Definition

1.  The relative luminance of a celestial body. The smaller
    (algebraically) the number indicating magnitude, the more luminous
    the body. Also called stellar magnitude. See absolute magnitude. The
    ratio of relative luminosity of two celestial bodies differing in
    magnitude by 1.0 is 2.512, the fifth root of 100. Decrease of light
    by a factor of 100 increases the stellar magnitude by 5.00; hence,
    the brightness objects have negative magnitudes (Sun: -26.8; mean
    full moon: -12.5; Venus at brightest: -4.3; Jupiter at opposition:
    -2.3; Sirius: -1.6; Vega: 0.2; Polaris: 2.1). The faintest stars
    visible to the naked eye on a clear dark night are of about the
    sixth magnitude (though on a perfectly black background the limit
    for a single luminous point approaches the eighth magnitude). The
    faintest stars visible with a telescope of aperture a (in inches) is
    one approximately of magnitude 9 + 5 log10 a . The magnitude of the
    faintest stars which can be photographed with the 200-inch telescope
    is about +22.7. The expression first magnitude is often used
    somewhat loosely to refer to all bodies of magnitude 1.5 or
    brighter, including negative magnitudes. 2. Amount; size; greatness.
