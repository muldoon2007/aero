# Definition

Generally, the time required for an instrument to indicate a given
percentage of the final reading resulting from an input signal; the
relaxation time of an instrument. In the case of instruments such as
thermometers, whose response to step changes in an applied signal is
exponential in character, the time constant is equal to the time
required for the instrument to indicate 63.2 percent of the total
change, that is, when the transient error is reduced to 1/e of the
original signal change. Also called lag coefficient. See lag. Compare
rise time, time lag.
