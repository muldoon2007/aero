# Definition

The principle that absolute angular momentum is a property which cannot
be created or destroyed by can only be transferred from one physical
system to another through the agency of a net torque on the system. As a
consequence, the absolute angular momentum of an isolated physical
system remains constant. The principle of conservation of angular
momentum can be derived from the Newton second law of motion.
