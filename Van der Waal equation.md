# Definition

The best known of the many laws which have been proposed to describe the
thermodynamic behavior of real gases and their departures from the ideal
gas laws. It states: \[p + (a/v2)\](v - b) = RT, where a and b are
constants dependent upon the gas; p is the pressure of the gas; v is its
specific volume (measured in units of the specific volume of the gas at
normal temperature and pressure); R is the universal gas constant; and T
is the Kelvin temperature.
