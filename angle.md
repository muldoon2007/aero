# Definition

The inclination to each other of two intersecting lines, measured by the
arc of a circle intercepted between the two lines forming the angle, the
center of the circle being the point of intersection. An acute angle is
less than 90°; a right angle 90 °; an obtuse angle, more than 90° but
less than 180 °; a straight angle, 180°; a reflex angle, more than 180°
but less than 360°; a perigon, 360°. Any angle not a multiple of 90° is
an oblique angle. If the sum of two angles is 90°, they are
complementary angles; if 180°, supplementary angles; if 360°,
explementary angles. Two adjacent angles have a common vertex and lie on
opposite sides of a common side. A dihedral angle is the angle between
two intersecting planes. A spherical angle is the angle between two
intersecting great circles.
