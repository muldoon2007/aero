# Definition

1.  The ability of electronic equipment to amplify a signal, measured by
    the minimum strength of signal input capable of causing a desired
    value of output. The lower the input signal for a given output, the
    higher the sensitivity. 2. In measurements, the derivative
    representing the change in instrument indication produced by a
    change in the variable being measured.
