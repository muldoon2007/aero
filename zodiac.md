# Definition

The band of the sky extending 8 degrees either side of the ecliptic. The
Sun, Moon, and navigational planets are always within this band, with
the occasional exception of Venus. The zodiac is divided into 12 equal
parts, called signs, each part being named for the principal
constellation originally within it.
