# Definition

A hypothetical antenna radiating or receiving equally in all directions.
Also called isotropic antenna. A pulsating sphere is a unipole for sound
waves. In the case of electromagnetic waves unipoles do not exist
physically but represent convenient reference antennas for expressing
directive properties of actual antennas.
