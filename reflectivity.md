# Definition

1.  A measure of the fraction of radiation reflected by a given surface;
    defined as the ratio of the radiant energy reflected to the total
    that is incident upon that surface. Compare reflection coefficient.
    See radar reflectivity. The reflectivity of any given substance is,
    in general, a variable strongly dependent upon the wavelength of the
    radiation in question. The reflectivity of a given surface for a
    specified broad spectral range, such as the visible spectrum or the
    solar spectrum, is referred to as the albedo. 2. In thermal
    radiation, a property of a material, measured as the reflectance of
    a specimen of the material that is thick enough to be completely
    opaque and has an optically smooth surface.
