# Definition

A sequence of atomic nuclear reactions and spontaneous radioactive decay
which serves to convert matter into energy in the form of radiation and
high-speed particles, and which is regarded as one of the principal
sources of the energy of the sun and other similar stars. This cycle,
first suggested by Bethe in 1938, gets its name from the fact that
carbon plays the role of a kind of catalyst in that it is both used by
and produced by the reaction, but is not consumed itself. Four protons
are, in net, converted into an alpha particle and two positrons (with
accompanying neutrinos); and three gamma-ray emissions are emitted
directly in addition to the two gamma emissions that ensue from
annihilation of the positrons by ambient electrons. This cycle sets in
at stellar interior temperatures of the order of 5 million degrees
Kelvin. An even simpler reaction, the proton-proton reaction, is also
believed to occur within the sun and may be of equal or greater
importance.
