# Definition

(A trade name, from autosynchronous, often capitalized). A
remote-indicating instrument or system based upon the synchronous-motor
principle, in which the angular position of the rotor of one motor at
the measuring source is duplicated by the rotor of the indicator motor,
used, e.g., in fuel-quantity or fuel-flow measuring systems,
position-indicating systems, etc.
