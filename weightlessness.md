# Definition

1.  A condition in which no acceleration, whether of gravity or other
    force, can be detected by an observer within the system in question.
    Any object failing freely in a vacuum is weightless, thus an
    unaccelerated satellite orbiting the earth is weightless although
    gravity affects its orbit. Weightlessness can be produced within the
    atmosphere in aircraft flying a parabolic flightpath. 2. A condition
    in which gravitational and other external forces acting on a body
    produce no stress, either internal or external, in the body.
