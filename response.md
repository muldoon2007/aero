# Definition

Of a device or system, the motion (or other output) resulting from an
excitation under specified conditions. Modifying phrases must be
prefixed to the term response to indicate what kinds of input and output
are being utilized. The response characteristic, often presented
graphically, gives the response as a function of some independent
variable such as frequency or direction. For such purposes it is
customary to assume that other characteristics of the input (for
example, voltage) are held constant.
