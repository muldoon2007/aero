# Definition

1.  Any refraction phenomenon observed in the light originating from a
    source lying within the earth's atmosphere; as contrasted to
    astronomical refraction, sense 2. This is applied only to refraction
    caused by inhomogeneities of the atmosphere itself, not, for
    example, to that caused by ice crystals suspended in the atmosphere.
    Terrestrial refraction is responsible for such phenomena of
    meteorological optics as looming, sinking, stooping, towering,
    mirages, and terrestrial scintillation. 2. = terrestrial refraction
    error.
