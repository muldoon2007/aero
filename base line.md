# Definition

1.  Any line which serves as the basis for measurement of other lines,
    as in a surveying triangulation, measurement of auroral heights,
    etc. 2. The geodesic line between two stations operating in
    conjunction for the determination of a line of position, as the two
    stations constituting a loran rate. 3. In radar, the line traced on
    amplitude-modulated indicators which corresponds to the power level
    of the weakest echo detected by the radar. It is retraced with every
    pulse transmitted by the radar, but appears as a nearly continuos
    display on the scope. Target signals show up as perpendicular
    deviations from the base line; range is measured along the base
    line; signal strength is indicated by the magnitude of the
    deviations; and the type of target usually can be determined by the
    appearance of the deviations.
