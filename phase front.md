# Definition

A surface of constant phase (or phase angle) of a propagating wave
disturbance. Also called wave front. Generally, phase fronts spread out
spherically from their source; but in cases where energy is assumed to
travel in parallel rays (as in many radiation problems), phase fronts
may be approximated as plane surfaces oriented perpendicularly to the
rays.
