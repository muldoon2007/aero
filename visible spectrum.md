# Definition

That portion of the electromagnetic spectrum occupied by the wavelengths
of visible radiation, roughly 4000 to 7000 angstroms. This portion of
the electromagnetic spectrum is bounded on the short-wavelength end by
ultraviolet radiation, and on the long-wavelength end by infrared
radiation.
