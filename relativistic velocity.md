# Definition

A velocity sufficiently high that some properties of a particle of this
velocity have values significantly different from those obtaining when
the particle is at rest. See rest mass. The property of most interest is
the mass. For many purposes, the velocity is relativistic when it
exceeds about one-tenth the velocity of light. See also
Fitzgerald-Lorentz contraction.
