# Definition

Specifically, in calculations of the transfer of radiant energy, the
mass of a given absorbing or emitting material lying in a vertical
column of unit cross-sectional area and extending between two specific
levels. Also called optical depth. If z1 and z2 are the lower and upper
limits, respectively, of a layer in which the variation of a density p
of some absorbing or emitting substance is given as a function of height
z, then the quantity is called the optical thickness of that substance
within that particular layer.
