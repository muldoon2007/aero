# Definition

A ionization gage (vacuum gage) in which the ions are produced by a
discharge between two electrodes, both near room temperature. The
discharge usually takes place in the presence of a magnetic field which
lengthens the path of the electrons between cathode and anode. One form
of gage is a transparent tube in which the color and form of a
cold-cathode discharge, without the presence of a magnetic field, give
an indication of the pressure and the nature of the gas. The Philips
ionization gage, or Penning gage, is a cold-cathode ionization gage in
which a magnetic field is used. Various modifications of the Penning
gage are named after the inventors, and certain types are referred to as
magnetron vacuum gages.
