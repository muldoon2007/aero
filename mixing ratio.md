# Definition

In a system of moist air, the dimensionless ratio of the mass of water
vapor to the mass of dry air. For many purposes, the mixing ratio may be
approximated by the specific humidity. In terms of the pressure p and
vapor pressure e, the mixing ratio w is w = (0.6222 e) / (p - e) Compare
absolute humidity, relative humidity, dew point.
