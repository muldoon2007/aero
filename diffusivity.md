# Definition

A measure of the rate of diffusion of a substance, expressed as the
diffusivity coefficient K. When K is constant, the diffusion equation is
where q is the substance diffused; 2 is the Laplacian operator; and t is
time. The diffusivity has dimensions of a length times a velocity; it
varies with the property diffused, and for any given property it may be
considered a constant or a function of temperature, space, etc.,
depending on the context. Also called coefficient of diffusion. See
conductivity, kinematic viscosity, exchange coefficients. In the case of
molecular diffusion the length dimension is the mean free path of the
molecules. By analogy, in eddy diffusion, length becomes the mixing
length. The coefficient is the called then eddy diffusivity, and is in
general several orders of magnitude larger than the molecular
diffusivity.
