# Definition

1.  The initial component or sensing element of a measuring system. For
    example, the receiver of a thermoelectric thermometer is the
    measuring thermocouple. 2. An instrument used to detect the presence
    of and to determine the information carried by electromagnetic
    radiation. A receiver includes circuits designed to detect, amplify,
    rectify, and shape the incoming radiofrequency signals received at
    the antenna in such a manner that the information- containing
    component of this received energy can be delivered to the desired
    indicating or recording equipment.
