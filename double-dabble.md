# Definition

A technique for binary to decimal conversion. Starting with the most
significant bit, proceed, bit-by-bit, as follows: If the next bit is 0,
double what you have (double); if the next bit is 1, double what you
have and add 1 (dabble). Thus, 111 (binary) = 7 (decimal) 10111 (binary)
= 23 (decimal).
