# Definition

The propagation of energy when it arrives at a destination via a path
significantly different from the normally expected path. The term is
usually applied to the transmission of various forms of energy through
the atmosphere when, in addition to the line-of-sight path, the energy
is refracted by density discontinuities at one or more levels in
atmosphere. Therefore, it propagates to a point that could not be
reached via a line-of-sight path. In radio and radar studies, it refers
to the abnormal refraction of a beam of radio energy, usually applied to
superstandard propagation rather than to substandard propagation. In
either case, anomalous propagation results from an unusual vertical
distribution of temperature and moisture in the atmosphere. The
anomalous propagation of sound refers to the downward refraction of an
oblique sound wave from an explosion, the refraction occurring in the
region of increasing temperature with height in the lower mesosphere.
The anomalous propagation of sound has been used as a method for
determining upper air temperatures and winds.
