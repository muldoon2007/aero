# Definition

The efficiency with which energy available for propulsion is converted
into thrust by a rocket engine. Î·p = (2u/c)/\[1 + (u/c)2\] where u is
the absolute vehicle velocity, and c is the effective exhaust velocity
with respect to the vehicle. Propulsive efficiency is a maximum when u =
c.
