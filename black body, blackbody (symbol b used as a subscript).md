# Definition

1.  An ideal emitter which radiates energy at the maximum possible rate
    per unit area at each wavelength for any given temperature. A black
    body also absorbs all the radiant energy in the near visible
    spectrum incident upon it. No actual substance behaves as a true
    black body, although platinum black and other soots rather closely
    approximate this ideal. However, one does speak of a black body with
    respect to a particular wavelength interval. This concept is
    fundamental to all the radiation laws, and is to be compared with
    the similarly idealized concepts of the white body and the gray
    body. In accordance with the Kirchhoff law, a black body not only
    absorbs all wavelengths, but emits at all wavelengths and does so
    with maximum possible intensity for any given temperature. 2. A
    laboratory device which simulates the characteristics of a black
    body (sense 1). See hohlraum.
