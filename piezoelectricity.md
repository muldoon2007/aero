# Definition

The property exhibited by some asymmetrical crystalline materials which
when subjected to strain in suitable directions develop electric
polarization proportional to the strain. Inverse piezoelectricity is the
effect in which mechanical strain is produced in certain asymmetrical
crystalline materials when subjected to an external electric field; the
strain is proportional to the electric field.
