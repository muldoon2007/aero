# Definition

1.  The ability to transmit, as electricity, heat, sound, etc. 2. A unit
    measure of electrical conduction; the facility with which a
    substance conducts electricity, as represented by the current
    density per unit electrical-potential gradient in the direction of
    flow. Electrical conductivity is the reciprocal of electrical
    resistivity and is expressed in units such as mhos (reciprocal ohms)
    per centimeter. It is an intrinsic property of a given type of
    material under given physical conditions (dependent mostly upon
    temperature). Conductance, on the other hand, varies with the
    dimensions of the conducting system, and is the reciprocal of the
    electrical resistance.
