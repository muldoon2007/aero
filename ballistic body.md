# Definition

A body free to move, behave, and be modified in appearance, contour, or
texture by ambient conditions, substances, or forces, as by the pressure
of gases in a gun, by rifling in a barrel, by gravity, by temperature,
or by air particles. A rocket with a self-contained propulsion unit is
not considered a ballistic body during the period of its guidance or
propulsion.
