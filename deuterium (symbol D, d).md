# Definition

A heavy isotope of hydrogen having one proton and one neutron in the
nucleus. The symbol D is often used to designate deuterium in compounds,
as HDO for molecules of that composition. Official chemical nomenclature
uses the designation d with a number which designates the carbon atom to
which deuterium is bound; e.g. 2-d propane designates CH 3 CHDCH 3 .
