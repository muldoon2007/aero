# Definition

Guidance in which a craft or vehicle is directed toward a destination by
means of information received from the destination in response to
transmissions from a source other than the craft. In active homing
guidance the information received is in response to transmissions from
the craft. In passive homing guidance natural radiations from the
destination are utilized.
