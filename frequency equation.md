# Definition

An equation relating phase speed to wavelength and to the physical
parameters of the system in a linear oscillation. Also called dispersion
equation. Mathematically, the frequency equation is the result of
substituting a simple harmonic solution in the homogeneous differential
equations of motion and the homogeneous boundary conditions. The
frequency equation thus describes the free waves of the system. See
group velocity.
