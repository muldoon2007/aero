# Definition

That region of the field in which the energy flow from an antenna
proceeds essentially as though coming from a point source located in the
vicinity of the antenna. If the antenna has a well-defined aperture a in
a given aspect, the Fraunhofer region in that aspect is commonly taken
to exist at distances greater than 2a2 / from the aperture, being the
wavelength.
