# Definition

One of the many small celestial bodies revolving around the sun, most of
the orbits being between those of Mars and Jupiter. Also called
planetoid, minor planet . See planet. The term minor planet is preferred
by many astronomers but asteroid continues to be used in astronomical
literature, especially attributively, as in asteroid belt. All asteroids
with determined orbits (except for a few discovered during World War II)
are numbered for identification in the order of their discovery. The
Ephemerides of the Minor Planets published by the U.S.S.R. Academy of
Sciences lists all numbered asteroids, data concerning them, and their
predicted positions. The daily positions of the first four minor planets
are tabulated in the American Ephemeris and Nautical Almanac. Orbits
have been determined for approximately 1700 asteroids. Asteroids have
names as well as numbers, see Table I. The names are usually feminine
but masculine names have been used for asteroids closer to or farther
away from the Sun than the majority. The first asteroid to be given a
masculine name, Eros (number 443) was the first to be discovered inside
the orbit of Mars. The Trojan asteroids, named for heroes of the Trojan
war, are in the orbit of Jupiter.
