# Definition

1.  In general, modulation in which the amplitude of a wave is the
    characteristic subject to variation. 2. Specifically, in telemetry
    those systems of modulation in which each component frequency, f, of
    the transmitted intelligence produces a pair of sideband frequencies
    at carrier frequency plus f and carrier minus f. In special
    cases: (a) the carrier may be suppressed, (b) either the lower or
    upper sets of sideband frequencies may be suppressed; (c) the lower
    set of sideband frequencies may be produced by one or more channels
    of information and the upper set of sideband frequencies may be
    produced by one or more other channels of information; (d) the
    carrier may be transmitted without intelligence carrying sideband
    frequencies.
