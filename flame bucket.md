# Definition

A deep cavelike construction built beneath a launcher, open at the top
to receive the hot gases of the rocket positioned above it, and open on
one or three sides below, with a thick metal fourth side bent toward the
open sides so as to deflect the exhausting gases. See flame deflector.
