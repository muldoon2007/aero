# Definition #fem
	- In the finite element method (FEM), a Gauss point is a specific location 
	  within an element (such as a triangular or quadrilateral element) where 
	  the element's properties are evaluated. These points are chosen to be at
	   the center of gravity of the element, and are used to integrate the 
	  element's properties over its entire area. The number of Gauss points 
	  used in a given element is determined by the order of the element, with 
	  higher-order elements requiring more Gauss points.
