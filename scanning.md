# Definition

In radar, the motion of the radar antenna assembly when searching for
targets. Scanning usually follows a systematic pattern involving one or
more of the following: (1) In horizontal scanning (or searchlighting),
the antenna is continuously rotated in azimuth around the horizon or in
a sector (sector scanning); used to generate
plan-position-indicator-scope displays. (b) Vertical scanning is
accomplished by holding the azimuth constant but varying the elevation
angle of the antenna; used in height-finding radars to generate the
relative-height-indicator-scope display. (c) For conical scanning, a
somewhat offcenter radiating element is rotated while its parabolic
reflectors fixed in position so that the radiated beam generates a
concially shaped volume with the antenna at the apex; used to determine
accurate bearing and elevation angle of targets and employed in
automatic tracking radars. (d) In helical scanning (or spiral scanning)
the azimuth and elevation angle of the antenna are constantly varied so
that at a given distance from the radar the radiated beam generates the
surface of a hemisphere; used for radio direction finding, in certain
types of search radars, and in tracking radars to search areas for
targets.
