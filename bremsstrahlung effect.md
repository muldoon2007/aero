# Definition

The emission of electromagnetic radiation as a consequence of the
acceleration of charged elementary particles, such as electrons, under
the influence of the attractive or repulsive force fields of atomic
nuclei near which the charged particle moves. In cosmic-ray shower
production, bremsstrahlung effects give rise to emission of gamma rays
as electrons encounter atmospheric nuclei. The emission of radiation in
the bremsstrahlung effect is merely one instance of the general rule
that electromagnetic radiation is emitted only when electric charges
undergo acceleration.
