# Definition

1.  The oscillation of the axis of any rotating body, as a gyroscope
    rotor. 2. Specifically, in astronomy, irregularities in the
    precessional motion of the equinoxes because of varying positions of
    the moon and, to a lesser extent, of other celestial bodies with
    respect to the ecliptic. Because of nutation, the earth's axis nods
    like a top, describing a slightly wavy circle about the ecliptic
    pole. The maximum displacement is about 9.21 seconds (constant of
    nutation) and the period of a complete cycle is 18.60 tropical years
    (period of moon's node, nutation period).
