# Definition

The lower portion of a two-part division of the atmosphere according to
the general homogeneity of atmospheric composition; opposed to the
heterosphere. The region in which there is no gross change in
atmospheric composition, that is, all the atmosphere from the earth's
surface to about 90 kilometers. See atmospheric shell. The homosphere is
about equivalent to the neutrosphere, and includes the troposphere,
stratosphere, and mesosphere; it also includes the ozonosphere and at
least part of the chemosphere.
