# Definition

1.  A flow regime in aerodynamics in which molecules emitted from an
    object, as it passes through a resistive medium, do not affect the
    flow of oncoming molecules by scattering interactions, i.e., the
    mean free path of the emitted molecules in much longer than a
    characteristic linear dimension of an object. 2. Flow about a body
    in which the number of collisions between the molecules of the fluid
    is negligible compared with the collisions between these molecules
    and the body. Also called free molecular flow. See rarefied gas
    dynamics, note.
