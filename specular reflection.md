# Definition

Reflection in which the reflected radiation is not diffused; reflection
as from a mirror. Also called regular reflection, simple reflection.
Compare diffuse reflection. The angle between the normal to the surface
and the incident beam is equal to the angle between the normal to the
surface and the reflected beam. Any surface irregularities on a specular
reflector must be small compared to the wavelength of the incident
radiation.
