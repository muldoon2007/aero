# Definition

Having the property of certain atomic nuclei, such as some isotopes of
uranium and plutonium, of capturing neutrons and thereupon splitting
into two particles with great kinetic energy. The term properly is
applicable to nuclei that undergo fission by neutrons of thermal
energies; but it sometimes is applied loosely to cases where the neutron
must be of high energy, an in U238 is fissionable by fast neutrons.
