# Definition

1.  The radiant flux per unit area emitted by a body. 2. The ratio of
    the emitted radiant flux per unit area of a sample to that of a
    black body radiator at the same temperature and under the same
    conditions. Spectral emittance refers to emittance measured at a
    specified wavelength. Because of the two common meanings of
    emittance, it should be defined when used unless the context allows
    no misinterpretation.
