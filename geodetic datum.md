# Definition

A datum consisting of five quantities, the latitude and longitude and
elevation above the reference spheroid of an initial point, a line from
this point, and two constants which define the reference spheroid.
Azimuth or orientation of the line, given the longitude, is determined
by astronomic observations. Alternatively, the datum may be considered
as three rectangular coordinates fixing the origin of a coordinate
system whose orientation is determined by the fixed stars, and the
reference spheroid is an arbitrary coordinate surface of an orbiting
ellipsoidal coordinate system. A geodetic datum forms the basis for the
computation of horizontal control surveys in which the curvature of the
earth is considered.
