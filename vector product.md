# Definition

A vector whose magnitude is equal to the product of the magnitudes of
any two given vectors and the sine of the angle between their positive
directions. Also called cross product, outer product. See scalar
product. For two vectors A and B, the vector product is often written A
X B (read A cross B), and defines a vector perpendicular to both A and B
and so directed that a right-hand rotation about A X B through an angle
of not more than 180 degrees carries A into B. The magnitude of A X B is
equal to twice the area of the triangle of which A and B are coterminous
sides. IF the vector product is zero, one of the vectors is zero or else
the two are parallel. When A and B are written in terms of their
components along the X-, Y-, and Z-axes of the rectangular Cartesian
coordinates, i.e., A = a1i + a2j + a3k B = b1i + b2j + b3k then the
vector product is the determinant .
