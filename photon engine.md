# Definition

A projected type of reaction engine in which thrust would be obtained
from a stream of electromagnetic radiation. Compare ion engine. Although
the thrust of this engine would be minute, it may be possible to apply
it for extended periods of time. Theoretically, in space, where no
resistance is offered by air particles, very high speeds may be built
up.
