# Definition

"The subatomic particle that possesses the smallest possible negative
electric charge (4.80298 \* 10-10 electrostatic units). See physical
constants, table. The mass of the electron is approximately equal to
1/1836 that of a hydrogen atom; its theoretical rest mass (symbol me) is
equal to 9.109 3897(54) \* 10-31 kg and its rest energy is equal to
0.510 999 06(15) million electron-volt. The charge-to-mass ratio for the
electron (symbol e/me) is 1.758796 cc� / g�. The term electron is
usually reserved for the orbital or extranuclear particle, whereas the
term beta particle refers to a nuclear electron. \*The numbers in bold
type were taken from the 1987 publication of Fundamental Physical
Constants: 1986 CODATA (Committee on Data for Science and Technology of
the International Council of Scientific Unions) Recommended Values
issued by the U. S. Department of Commerce, National Bureau of
Standards. ""Digits in parentheses represent one standard deviation
uncertainty in the final digits of the given value, based on a
least-squares analysis with five variables and 17 degrees of freedom."""
