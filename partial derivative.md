# Definition

The ordinary derivative of a function of two or more variables with
respect to one of the variables, the others being considered constants.
If the variables are x and y , the partial derivatives of f(x, y) are
written Δf/Δx and Δf/Δy, or Dxf and Dyf, or fx and fy. The partial
derivative of a variable with respect to time is known as the local
derivative.
