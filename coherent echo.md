# Definition

A radar echo whose phase and amplitude at a given range remain
relatively constant. Hills, buildings, and slowly moving point targets
such as ships are examples of objects which produce coherent radar
echoes. Volume targets (such as clouds and precipitation) give
noncoherent echoes. The classification of an echo as coherent or
noncoherent is closely related to the spatial resolution (beam width) of
the radar or the volume occupied by the radar pulse. Thus, small
atmospheric inhomogeneities which give rise to noncoherent echoes, would
give coherent echoes if the radar volume were reduced in size to the
order of magnitude of the inhomogeneities themselves.
