# Definition

Uniform meteorological conditions at a given altitude, over the area
under consideration. The term horizontally stratified atmosphere is
generally assumed to mean complete stratification at each altitude. It
follows that the vertical profile, which need not be a standard profile,
is consistent over the area under consideration. When the condition
extends over a large area, the term spherical stratification is used.
