# Definition

A measure of the concentration of power of a directional antenna. It is
the angle in degrees subtended at the antenna by arbitrary power-level
points across the axis of the beam. This power level is usually the
point where the power density is one-half that which is present in the
axis of the beam at the same distance from the antenna (half-power
points). Also called beam angle . The beam width of a radar determines
the minimum angular separation which two targets can have and still be
resolved. Roughly speaking, two targets at the same range whose angular
separations at the radar antenna exceeds one-half of the beam width
between half-power points will be resolved or distinguishable as two
individual targets. The smaller the beam width, the greater the annular
resolving power. Beam width may be at different locations through the
axis depending upon the shape of the antenna reflector.
