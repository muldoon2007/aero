# Definition

A visible trail of condensed water vapor or ice particles left behind an
aircraft, an airfoil, etc. in motion through the air. Also called a
contrail or vapor trail. There are three kinds of condensation trails:
the aerodynamic type, caused by reduced pressure of the air in certain
areas as it flows past the aircraft; the convection type, caused by the
rising of air warmed by an engine; and the engine-exhaust, or
exhaust-moisture, type, formed by the ejection of water vapor from an
engine into a cold atmosphere.
