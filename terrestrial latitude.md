# Definition

Latitude on the earth; angular distance from the equator. See
coordinate, Table VI. Terrestrial latitude is named for the datum used
to measure angular distance from the equator. Astronomical latitude is
the angular distance between the direction of gravity and the plane of
the equator. Geodetic or topographical latitude is the angular distance
between the plane of the equator and a normal to the spheroid. Geodetic
and sometimes astronomical latitude are also called geographic latitude.
Geocentric latitude is the angle between a line to the center of the
earth and the plane of the equator. Geodetic latitude is used for
charts.
