# Definition

A law of physics which states that the radiant intensity (flux per unit
solid angle) emitted in any direction from a unit radiating surface
varies as the cosine of the angle between the normal to the surface and
the direction of the radiation. The radiance (or luminance) of a
radiating surface is, therefore, independent of direction. Also called
Lambert cosine law. Compare cosine law of illumination. Lambert law is
not obeyed exactly by most real surfaces, but an ideal black body emits
according to this law. This law is also satisfied (by definition) by the
distribution of radiation from a perfectly diffuse radiator and by the
radiation reflected by a perfectly diffuse reflector. In accordance with
Lambert law, an incandescent special black body when viewed from a
distance appears to be simply a uniformly illuminated disk. This law
does not take into account any effects that may alter the radiation
after it leaves the source.
