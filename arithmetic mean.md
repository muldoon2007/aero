# Definition

One of several accepted measures of central tendency, physically
analogous to center of gravity. Pertaining to a set of numbers x 1,
x2,…xn, the arithmetic mean, usually denoted by the symbol , is the sum
x1+x2+…+xn divided by n. Also called mean, average, simple average .
Since the word mean is also applied to other measures of central
tendency, such as weighted means, geometric means, harmonic means, the
adjective arithmetic is used for clarity. However, when used without
further qualification, the term mean is understood as arithmetic mean.
