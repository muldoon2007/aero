# Definition

The resultant motion of the components causing precession of the
equinoxes. The general precession is westward along the ecliptic at the
rate of about 50.3 seconds of arc per year. The effect of the sun and
moon, called lunisolar precession, is to produce a westward motion of
the equinoxes along the ecliptic. The effect of other planets, called
planetary precession, tends to produce a much smaller motion eastward
along the ecliptic. The component of general precession along the
celestial equator, called precession in right ascension, is about 46.1
seconds of arc per year; and the component along a celestial meridian,
called precession in declination, is about 20.0 seconds of arc per year.
