# Definition

1.  Motion due to a continuous change in the magnitude of a given force
    which reversed its direction with time. Vibration is generally
    interpreted as the cyclical (symmetrical or nonsymmetrical)
    fluctuations in the rate at which an object accelerates. In
    longitudinal vibration the direction of motion of the particles is
    the same as the direction of advance of the vibratory motion; in
    transverse vibration it is perpendicular to the direction of
    advance. 2. The motion of an oscillating body during one complete
    cycle; two oscillations.
