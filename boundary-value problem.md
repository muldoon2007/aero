# Definition

A physical problem completely specified by a differential equation in an
unknown, valid in a certain region of space, and certain information
(boundary condition) about the unknown, given on the boundaries of that
region. The information required to determine the solution depends
completely and uniquely on the particular problem. See initial-value
problem.
