# Definition

Any structure, machine, or contrivance, especially a vehicle, designed
to be supported by the air, being borne up either by the dynamic action
of the air upon the surfaces of the structure or object, or by its own
buoyancy; such structures, machines, or vehicles collectively, as, fifty
aircraft. Aircraft, in its broadest meaning, includes fixed-wing
airplanes, helicopters, gliders, airships, free and captive balloons,
ornithopters, flying model aircraft, kites, etc., but since the term
carries a strong vehicular suggestion, it is more often applied, or
recognized to apply, only to such of these craft as are designed to
support or convey a burden in or through the air.
