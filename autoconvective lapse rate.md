# Definition

The environmental lapse rate of temperature in an atmosphere in which
the density is constant with height (homogenous atmosphere), equal to
g/R, where g is the acceleration of gravity and R the gas constant. For
dry air the autoconvective lapse rate is approximately +3.4 x 10-4 Â°C
per centimeter. Also called autoconvection gradient.
