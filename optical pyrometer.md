# Definition

A device for measuring the temperature of an incandescent radiating body
by comparing its brightness for a selected wavelength interval within
the visible spectrum with that of a standard source; a monochromatic
radiation pyrometer. Temperatures measured by optical pyrometers are
known as brightness temperatures and except for black bodies are less
than the true temperatures.
