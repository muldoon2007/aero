# Definition

1.  The potential associated with the force of gravitation arising from
    the attraction between mass points, e.g., the earth's center and a
    particle in space. The gravitational potential, associated with the
    force of gravitation, should not be confused with the geopotential
    associated with the force of gravity. The latter is equal to the
    former plus the centrifugal force due to the earth's rotation. The
    potentials of the three forces are related in the same manner. 2. At
    any point, the work needed to remove an object from that point to
    infinity.
