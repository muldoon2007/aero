# Definition

1.  Referring to a self-generating or self-sustaining process;
    specifically, the operation of liquid-propellant rocket engines in
    which, during main-stage operation, the gas generator is fed by the
    main propellants pumped by the turbopump, and the turbopump in turn
    is driven by hot gases from the gas generator system. Such a system
    must be started in its operation by outside power or propellants.
    When its operation is no longer dependent on outside power or
    propellant the system is said to be in bootstrap operation. 2. In
    computer operations, the coded instructions at the beginning of an
    input tape which together with manually inserted instructions,
    initiate a routine. 3. = leap-frog. See, leapfrog test.
