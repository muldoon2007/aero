# Definition

For a given wavelength of visible radiation, the ratio of the flux that
is effectively sensed by the human eye to the flux that is intrinsic in
the radiation. It may be represented as a dimensionless ratio, e.g.,
lumens per watt. Also called luminosity. Thus, luminous efficiency is a
weighting factor which is applied to radiation quantities so that they
are related physiologically to the response of the human eye, which
varies as a function of wavelength. All quantities which are weighted in
this manner should be modified by the term luminous (e.g., luminous
emittance, luminous flux, etc.)
