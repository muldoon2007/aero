# Definition

An inequality asserting that it is impossible to transfer heat from a
colder to a warmer system without the occurrence of other simultaneous
changes in the two systems or in the environment. It follows from this
law that during an adiabatic process, entropy cannot decrease. For
reversible adiabatic processes entropy remains constant, and for
irreversible adiabatic processes it increases. Another equivalent
formulation of the law is that it is impossible to convert the heat of a
system into work without the occurrence of other simultaneous changes in
the system or its environment. This version, which requires an engine to
have a cold source as well as a heat source, is particularly useful in
engineering applications. See first law of thermodynamics.
