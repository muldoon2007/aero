# Definition

Darkness in a region, caused by an obstruction between the source of
light and the region. By extension, the term is applied to a similar
condition when any form of radiant energy is cut off by an obstruction,
as a radar shadow. The darkest part of a shadow in which light is
completely cut off is called the umbra; a lighter part surrounding the
umbra, in which the light is only partly cut off, is called the
penumbra.
