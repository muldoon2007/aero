# Definition

Name applied to a radio meteor when a detection system is used in which
the presence of the meteor is indicated by a rapidly changing
audiofrequency radio signal. The maximum reflection of a radio signal
from a radio meteor occurs when the ion column is perpendicular to the
line from the column to the transmitter-receiver. During the approach of
the meteor to this position, the Doppler effect causes a change in the
frequency of the reflected signal. When the reflected signal frequency
is then combined with the transmitter frequency, the difference between
the transmitted and reflected frequencies produces an audiofrequency
beat. The audiofrequency beat, when amplified and fed to a loudspeaker,
allows the meteors to be heard as a high-pitched whistle which rapidly
falls to zero frequency as the meteor trail becomes normal to the line
of sight.
