# Definition

1.  A unit of length, usually defined as the distance from the earth to
    the sun, 149,599,000 kilometers. This value for the AU was derived
    from radar observations of the distance of Venus. The value given in
    astronomical ephemerides, 149,500,000 kilometers, was derived from
    observations of the minor planet Eros. 2. The unit of distance in
    terms of which, in the Kepler Third Law, n2a3 = k2(1+m) , the
    semimajor axis a of an elliptical orbit must be expressed in order
    that the numerical value of the Gaussian constant k may be exactly
    0.01720209895 when the unit of time is the ephemeris day. In
    astronomical units, the mean distance of the earth from the sun,
    calculated by the Kepler law from the observed mean motion n and
    adopted mass m, is 1.00000003.
