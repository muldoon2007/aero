# Definition

The spherical triangle solved in computing altitude and azimuth. See
celestial triangle. The celestial triangle is formed on the celestial
sphere by the great circles connecting the elevated pole, zenith of the
assumed position of the observer, and a celestial body. The terrestrial
triangle is formed on the earth by the great circles connecting the pole
and two places on the earth. The term astronomical triangle applies to
either the celestial or terrestrial triangle used for solving celestial
observations.
