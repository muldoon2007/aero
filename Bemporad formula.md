# Definition

A formula for the optical air mass m in terms of the zenith distance z
of the sun or other celestial body: m = R/58.36 sec sin z where R is
astronomical refraction, seconds of arc. For values of z less than about
70ï¿½, the Bemporad formula can be replaced by the simpler approximate
formula, m = sec z
