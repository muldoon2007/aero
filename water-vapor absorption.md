# Definition

The absorption of certain wavelengths of infrared radiation by
atmospheric water vapor. See absorption band. The water-vapor absorption
spectrum is composed of bands near 1.4, 1.8, 2.7, and 6.3 microns and a
series of bands beginning at 11 microns and growing stronger with
increasing wavelength.
