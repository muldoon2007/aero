In radar, a rectangular display in which a target appears as a laterally
centralized blip when the radar antenna is aimed at it in azimuth and
wings appear to grow on the blip as the distance to the target is
diminished. Horizontal and vertical aiming errors are respectively
indicated by horizontal and vertical displacement of the blip. Also
called G-scan, G-scope, G-indicator.
