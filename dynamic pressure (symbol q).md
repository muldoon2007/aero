# Definition

The pressure of a fluid resulting from its motion, equal to one-half the
fluid density times the fluid velocity squared (1/2pV2). In
incompressible flow, dynamic pressure is the difference between total
pressure and static pressure. Also called kinetic pressure. Compare
impact pressure.
