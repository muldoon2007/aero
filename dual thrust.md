# Definition

A rocket thrust derived from two propellant grains using the same
propulsion section of a missile. The dual-thrust technique is considered
to provide what is in effect a two-stage propulsion system without the
disadvantages of jettisoning the booster unit and with the advantages of
lower weight and shorter length.
