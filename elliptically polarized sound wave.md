# Definition

A transverse wave in an elastic medium in which the displacement vector
at any point rotates about the point and has a magnitude which varies as
the radius vector of an ellipse. An elliptically polarized wave is
equivalent to two superposed plane polarized waves of simple sinusoidal
form in which the displacements lie in perpendicular planes and are 90ï¿½
apart in phase.
