# Definition

The potential temperature corresponding to the adiabatic equivalent
temperature: e = Ta, e (1000 / p)0.286 where e is the equivalent
potential temperature; Ta, e is the adiabatic equivalent temperature;
and p is the pressure in millibars. This temperature is conservative
with respect to dry-adiabatic and pseudoadiabatic processes.
