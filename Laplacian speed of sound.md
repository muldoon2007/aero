# Definition

The phase speed of a sound wave in a compressible fluid if the
expansions and compression are assumed to be adiabatic. This speed a is
given by the formula a2 = (cp/cv) RT where cp and cv are the specific
heats at constant pressure and volume, respectively; R is gas constant;
and T is the Kelvin temperature. The value of this speed under standard
conditions in dry air is 331 meters per second. Compare Newtonian speed
of sound. See acoustic velocity.
