# Definition

An atmospheric tide due to the thermal or gravitational action of the
sun. Six and eight hour components of small amplitude have been
observed. They are primarily thermal in origin. The 12-hour component
has by many times the greatest amplitude of any atmospheric tidal
component, about 1.5 millibars at the equator and 0.5 millibar in middle
latitudes. This relatively large amplitude is often explained as a
resonance effect. The 24-component is a thermal tide with great local
variability.
