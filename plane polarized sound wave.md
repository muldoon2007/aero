# Definition

At a point in an elastic medium, a transverse wave in which the
displacements at all times lie in a fixed plane which is parallel to the
direction of propagation. Also called linearly polarized sound wave. The
above definition is equivalent to stating that, in a plane polarized
sound wave, the displacement vector at any point lies in a fixed
straight line passing through the point.
