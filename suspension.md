# Definition

In physical chemistry, a system composed of one substance (suspended
phase, suspensoid) dispersed throughout another substance (suspending
phase) in a moderately finely divided state, but not so finely divided
as to acquire the stability of a colloidal system. Given sufficient
time, a suspension will, be definition, separate itself by gravitational
action into two visibly distinct portions, whereas a colloidal system,
by definition, is stable. Dust in the atmosphere is an example of a
suspension of a solid in a gas.
