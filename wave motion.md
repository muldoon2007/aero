# Definition

The oscillatory motion of the particles of a medium caused by the
passage of a wave, produced by forces external to the medium, but
propagated through the medium by internal forces. Wave motion per se
involves no net translation of the medium. Various types of oscillation
are found in natural wave motions. Among the simplest are the linear
oscillation parallel to the direction of propagation of a longitudinal
wave, the linear oscillation perpendicular to the direction of
propagation of a transverse wave, and the orbital motion produced by the
passage of a progressive gravity wave.
