# Definition

An orthogonal, or mutually perpendicular, system of curvilinear
coordinates for the description of fluid motion, consisting of an axis T
tangent to the instantaneous velocity vector and an axis N normal to
this velocity vector to the left in the horizontal plane, to which a
vertically directed axis Z may be added for the description of
three-dimensional flow.
