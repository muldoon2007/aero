# Definition

A region of indeterminate limits in the upper atmosphere, considered as
a boundary or transition region between the denser portion of the
atmosphere and space. From a functional point of view, it is considered
to be that region in which the atmosphere is so tenuous as to have a
negligible, or almost negligible, effect on men and aircraft, and in
which the physiological requirements of man become increasingly
important in the design of aircraft and auxiliary equipment.
