# Definition

A body that reflects radiant energy in such a manner that the reflected
energy may be treated as if it were being emitted (radiated) in
accordance with Lambert law. The radiant intensity reflected in any
direction from a unit area of such a reflector varies as the cosine of
the angle between the normal to the surface and the direction of the
reflected radiant energy.
