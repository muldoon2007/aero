# Definition

1.  An atmospheric wave in a two-dimensional nondivergent flow, the
    driving mechanism for which lies in the variation of vorticity of
    the basic current and/or in the variation of the vorticity of the
    earth about the local vertical. When the basic current is uniform,
    the wave is a Rossby wave . Also called barotropic wave . 2. An
    atmospheric wave of cyclonic scale in which troughs and ridges are
    approximately vertical.
