# Definition

A phenomenon in which sound or radio energy may be detected only at
various distance intervals from the energy source as the result of the
presence of an energy reflecting or refracting layer in the atmosphere.
See radio duct. For long radio waves, the ionosphere acts as the
reflecting layer. For shorter wavelengths, the effect may be produced by
strong superstandard propagation in elevated layers of the troposphere.
Skip effects make it possible on occasion to detect targets at distances
far greater than the normal radio horizon, while closer targets remain
undetected.
