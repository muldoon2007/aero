# Definition

A measure of the effective heat capacity of an ablating material,
numerically the heating rate input divided by the mass loss rate which
results from ablation. In the most general case, heat of ablation is
given by (qc + qr - σεTw4)/m where qc is convective heat transfer in the
absence of ablation; qr is radiative heat transfer from hot gases to
ablation material; σεTw4 is rate of heat rejection by radiation from
external surface of ablation material; and m is rate at which gaseous
ablation products are injected into the boundary layer. Heat of ablation
is sometimes evaluated neglecting the heat rejected by radiation and as
a result unrealistically high heats of ablation are obtained. If qr &\<;
σεTw4, for moderate values of stream enthalpy hs, heat of ablation is
given by Hv + μ (hs - hw) where Hs is heat required to cause a unit
weight of mass to be injected into boundary layer; μ is blocking factor
with numerical value from about 0.2 to 0.6 depending on material and
type of flow; and hw is enthalpy at wall temperature.
