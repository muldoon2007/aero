# Definition

Any one of different values of energy which a particle, atom, or
molecule may adopt under conditions where the possible values are
restricted by quantizing conditions. During transitions from one energy
level to another, quanta of radiant energy are emitted or absorbed,
their frequency depending on the difference between the energy levels.
