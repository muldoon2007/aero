# Definition

A measure of the space rate of attenuation of any transmitted
electromagnetic radiation. The attenuation coefficient is defined by dI
= -aI0dx or I = I0e-ax where I is the flux density at the selected point
in space; I0 is the flux density at the source; x is the distance from
the source; and a is the attenuation coefficient. In general, the
attenuation coefficient is specified only when the attenuation is known
to be due to both absorption and scattering, or when it is impossible to
determine which is the cause. See absorption coefficient, scattering
coefficient.
