# Definition

The state of an atmosphere at rest, uninfluenced by any external agency,
in which the conduction of heat from one part to another has, after a
sufficient length of time, produced a uniform temperature throughout its
entire mass. Also called conductive equilibrium. See diffusive
equilibrium, isothermal atmosphere.
