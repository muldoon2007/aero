# Definition

The apparent height of an ionized atmospheric layer determined from the
time interval between the transmitted signal and the ionospheric echo at
vertical incidence, assuming that the velocity of propagation is the
velocity of light in a vacuum over the entire path. See ionospheric
recorder. Compare scale height.
