# Definition

The process whereby electrons released by thermionic emission are
collected and utilized as electric current. The simplest example of this
is provided by a vacuum tube, in which the electrons released from a
heated anode are collected at the cathode or plate. Used as a method of
producing electrical power for spacecraft.
