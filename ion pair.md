# Definition

The pair of ions, one positively and the other negatively charged,
formed by the ionization of an initially neutral gas atom when it
collides with a high-energy particle. It is customary to measure the
ionizing efficiency of cosmic rays and radioactive materials in terms of
the number of ion pairs they produce each second in 1 cubic centimeter
of air. The symbol I is usually employed to designate the formation of
one ion pair per cubic centimeter per second. Thus, cosmic rays are said
to yield about 21 at sea level, and alpha particles from the radioactive
gases contribute about 51 over land areas at the surface.
