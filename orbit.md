# Definition

1.  The path of a body or particle under the influence of a
    gravitational or other force. For instance, the orbit of a celestial
    body is its path relative to another body around which it revolves.
    Orbit is commonly used to designate a closed path and trajectory to
    denote a path which is not closed. Thus, the trajectory of a
    sounding rocket, the orbit of a satellite. 2. To go around the earth
    or other body in an orbit, sense 1.
