# Definition

1.  The angular difference between the apparent zenith distance of a
    celestial body and its true zenith distance, produced by refraction
    effects as the light from the body penetrates the atmosphere. Also
    called atmospheric refraction, astronomical refraction error. See
    Bemporad formula. For bodies near zenith the astronomical refraction
    is only about 0.1 minute, but for bodies near the horizon it becomes
    about 30 minutes or more and contributes measurably to the length of
    the apparent day. 2. Any refraction phenomenon observed in the light
    originating from a source outside of the earth's atmosphere; as
    contrasted with terrestrial refraction. This is applied only to
    refraction caused by inhomogeneities of the atmosphere itself, and
    not to that caused by ice crystals suspended in the atmosphere.
