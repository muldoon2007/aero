# Definition

A measure of sunspot activity, computed from the formula R = k (10 g +
f) where R is the relative sunspot number; f is the number of individual
spots; g is the number of groups of spots; and k a factor that varies
with the observer (his personal equation), the seeing, and the
observatory (location and instrumentation). Also called sunspot number,
sunspot relative number, Wolf number, Wolf-Wolfer number, Zurich number.
