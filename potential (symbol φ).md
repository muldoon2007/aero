# Definition

1.  A function of space, the gradient of which is equal to a force. In
    symbols, F = -φ, where F is the force; is the del-operator; and φ is
    the potential. A force which may be so expressed is said to be
    conservative, and the work done against it in motion from one given
    equipotential surface to another is independent of the path of the
    motion. See Gibbs function, potential energy. In celestial mechanics
    and geodesy, the negative of the potential, sometimes called force
    function, is usually employed. 2. Applied to the value that an
    atmospheric thermodynamic variable would attain if processed
    adiabatically from its initial pressure to the standard pressure of
    1000 millibars. See potential density, potential temperature. 3.
    Short for electric potential.
