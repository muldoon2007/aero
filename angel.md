# Definition

A radar echo caused by a physical phenomenon not discernible to the eye.
Angels are usually coherent echoes and sometimes of great signal
strength (up to 40 decibels above the noise level). They have been
ascribed to insects flying through the radar beam, but have also been
observed under atmospheric conditions which indicate there must be other
causes. Studies indicate that a fair portion of them are caused by
strong temperature or moisture gradients, or both, such as might be
found near the boundaries of bubbles of especially warm or moist air
(see blob). They frequently occur in shallow layers at or near
temperature inversions within the lowest few thousand feet of the
atmosphere.
