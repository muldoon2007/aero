# Definition

1.  The angle at which a ray of energy impinges upon a surface, usually
    measured between the direction of propagation of the energy and a
    perpendicular to the surface at the point of impingement, or
    incidence. Compare angle of arrival. See also angle of reflection,
    angle of refraction. In some cases involving radio waves, the angle
    of incidence is measured relative to the surface. 2. = angle of
    attack. (British usage).
