# Definition

Any electrical discharge which produces luminosity. Thus corona
discharge is a glow discharge, but point discharge is not. Relatively
high electric field strengths are required for glow discharges, for the
density of radiatively recombining gas atoms and molecules must be high.
See gaseous electronics.
