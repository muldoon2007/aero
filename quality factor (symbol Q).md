# Definition

A measure of the sharpness of resonance or frequency selectivity of a
resonant vibratory system having a single degree of freedom, either
mechanical or electrical. See vibration. In a mechanical system, this
quantity is very nearly equal to one-half the reciprocal of the damping
ratio. When used with reference to a lightly damped system, it is also
approximately equal to the following: (1) transmissibility at resonance;
(2) π/δ where δ is the logarithmic decrement; (3) 2πW/ΔW where W is the
stored energy and ΔW the energy dissipation per cycle; and (4) fr/Δf
where fr is the resonance frequency and Δf is the bandwidth between the
half-power points. Historically the letter Q was an arbitrarily chosen
symbol to designate the ratio of reactance to resistance of a circuit
element. The name quality factor was introduced later.
