Dark lines in the absorption spectrum of solar radiation due to
absorption by gases in the outer portions of the sun and in the earth's
atmosphere. Fraunhofer lines are designated by letters, as the K-line,
or by wavelength, as the 4046-angstrom line of iron. The major
Fraunhofer lines are: angstroms (nm) Line due to A 7594 Telluric oxygen
