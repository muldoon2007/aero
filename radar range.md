# Definition

1.  The distance from a radar to a target as measured by the radar. 2.
    The maximum distance at which a radar set is effective in detecting
    targets. Radar range depends upon variables such as weather
    conditions, type of target, etc. Radar range, sense 2, is sometimes
    given a specific definition, e.g., the range at which the set is
    effective one-half of the time.
