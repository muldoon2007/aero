# Definition

In electronic computers: 1. A system consisting of (a) a well-defined,
usually finite, set of characters; (b) rules for combining characters
with one another or form words or other expressions; and (c) a specific
assignment of meaning to some of the words or expressions, usually for
communicating information or data among a group of people, machines,
etc. 2. A system similar to the above but without any specific
assignment of meanings. Such systems may be distinguished from sense 1
above, when necessary, by referring to them as formal or uninterpreted
languages. See code, machine language. Although it is sometimes
convenient to study a language independently of any meanings, in all
practical cases at least one set of meanings is eventually assigned.
