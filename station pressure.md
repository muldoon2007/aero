# Definition

The atmospheric pressure computed for the level of the station
elevation. This may or may not be the same as either the climatological
station pressure or the actual pressure, the difference being
attributable to the difference in reference elevations. Station pressure
usually is the base value from which sea-level pressure and altimeter
setting are determined.
