# Definition

A subatomic particle of zero, or near zero, rest mass, having no
electric charge, postulated by Fermi (1934) in order to explain apparent
contradictions to the law of conservation of energy in beta-particle
emission. According to Fermi theory, the atomic nucleus in beta decay
releases energy partly in the form of electrons (beta particles) and
partly in the form of neutrinos.
