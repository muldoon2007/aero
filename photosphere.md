# Definition

The intensely bright portion of the sun visible to the unaided eye. The
photosphere is that portion of the sun's atmosphere which emits the
continuum radiation upon which the Fraunhofer lines are superimposed. In
one sun model, the photosphere is thought to be below the reversing
layer in which Fraunhofer absorption takes place. In another model, all
strata are considered equally effective in producing continuous
emissions and line absorption.
