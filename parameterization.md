# Definition

The representation, in a mathematical model, of physical effects in
terms of admittedly oversimplified parameters, rather than realistically
requiring such effects to be consequences of the dynamics of the system.
Parameterization is often used in system analysis to determine the
effect on the system of changing one parameter while holding other
parameters constant.
