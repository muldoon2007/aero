# Definition

Any one of six gases, helium, neon, argon, krypton, xenon, and radon,
all of whose shells of planetary electrons contain stable numbers of
electrons so that the atoms are almost completely chemically inactive.
Also called rare gas. All these gases are found in the earth's
atmosphere but, with the exception of argon, are found only in very
small amounts. Fluorine compounds of the rare gases have only recently
been discovered.
