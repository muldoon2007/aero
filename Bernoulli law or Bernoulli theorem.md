(After Daniel Bernoulli, 1700-1782, Swiss scientist)
  * In aeronautics, a law or theorem stating that in a flow of
	     incompressible fluid the sum of the **static pressure** and
	     the **dynamic pressure** along a streamline is constant if
	     gravity and frictional effects are disregarded. From this law
	     it follows that where there is a velocity increase in a fluid
	     flow there must be a corresponding pressure decrease. Thus an
	     airfoil, by increasing the velocity of the flow over its
	     upper surface, derives lift from the decreased pressure.
  *  As originally formulated, a statement of the conservation of
	    energy (per unit mass) for a nonviscous fluid in steady
	    motion. The specific energy is composed of the kinetic energy
	    $u^2/2$, where u is the speed of the fluid; the potential
	    energy gz, where g is the acceleration of gravity and z is the
	    height above an arbitrary reference level; and the work done
	    by the pressure forces of a compressible fluid v dp, where p
	    is the pressure, v is the specific volume, and the integration
	    is always with respect to values of p and v on the same
	    parcel. Thus, the relationship = Constant along a streamline
	    is valid for a compressible fluid in steady motion, since the
	    streamline is also the path. If the motion is also
	    irrotational, the same constant holds for the entire fluid.
