(After Daniel Bernoulli, 1700-1782, Swiss scientist)
	- 1. In aeronautics, a law or theorem stating that in a flow of
	     incompressible fluid the sum of the **static pressure** and
	     the **dynamic pressure** along a streamline is constant if
	     gravity and frictional effects are disregarded. From this law
	     it follows that where there is a velocity increase in a fluid
	     flow there must be a corresponding pressure decrease. Thus an
	     airfoil, by increasing the velocity of the flow over its upper
	     surface, derives lift from the decreased pressure.
	- 2. As originally formulated, a statement of the conservation of
	    energy (per unit mass) for a nonviscous fluid in steady motion.
	    The specific energy is composed of the kinetic energy u2/2, where
	    u is the speed of the fluid; the potential energy gz, where g is
	    the acceleration of gravity and z is the height above an arbitrary
	    reference level; and the work done by the pressure forces of a
	    compressible fluid v dp, where p is the pressure, v is the
	    specific volume, and the integration is always with respect to
	    values of p and v on the same parcel. Thus, the relationship =
	    Constant along a streamline is valid for a compressible fluid in
	    steady motion, since the streamline is also the path. If the
	    motion is also irrotational, the same constant holds for the
	    entire fluid.
