# Definition

In plasma physics, a measure of the relative importance of the magnetic
field and the fluid motion when the magnetic lines are at least
partially frozen into the fluid. It is related to the ratio of the
magnetic energy density and the fluid kinetic energy. If the interaction
parameter is small, the fluid motion is hardly affected by the field; if
it is large, the motion is largely controlled by the field; if it is the
order of unity, the two strongly interact, with the net flow a
compromise between them.
