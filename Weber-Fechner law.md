# Definition

An approximate psychophysical law relating the degree of response or
sensation of a sense organ and the intensity of the stimulus. The law
asserts that equal increments of sensation are associated with equal
increments of the logarithm of the stimulus, or that the just noticeable
difference in any sensation results from a change in the stimulus which
bears a constant ratio to the value of the stimulus. Also called Weber
law . The Weber-Fechner law is applied to the detection of contrast in
the problem of visual range, as well as to many other psychophysical
problems.
