# Definition

A force introduced in a relative coordinate system in order that Newton
laws of motion be satisfied in this system. This force must be equal and
opposite to an acceleration in an inertial coordinate system, in which
Newton laws are (by definition) satisfied. Examples are the coriolis
force, and the centrifugal force incorporated in gravity.
