# Definition

The frequency of free vibration of a damped linear system. The
oscillation of a damped system may be considered periodic in the limited
sense that the time interval between zero crossings in the same
direction is constant if the system is linear, even though successive
amplitudes decrease progressively. The frequency of the oscillation is
the reciprocal of this time interval. The damped natural frequency
decreases as the damping increases, and approaches zero as the damping
approaches critical damping.
