# Definition

A set of three fundamental postulates forming the basis of the mechanics
of rigid bodies, formulated by Newton in 1687. The first law is
concerned with the principle of inertia and states that if a body in
motion is not acted upon by an external force, its momentum remains
constant (law of conservation of momentum). The second law asserts that
the rate of change of momentum of a body and is in the direction of the
applied force. A familiar statement of this is the equation F = ma where
F is vector sum of the applied forces, m is the mass, and a is the
vector acceleration of the body. The third law is the principle of
action and reaction, stating that for every force acting upon a body
there exists a corresponding force of the same magnitude exerted by the
body in the opposite direction.
