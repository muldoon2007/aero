# Definition

A statistical significance test based on frequency of occurrence; it is
applicable both to qualitative attributes and quantitative variables.
Among its many uses, the most common are test of hypothesized
probabilities or probability distributions (goodness of fit),
statistical dependence or independence (association), and common
population (homogeneity). The formula for chi square (x2) depends upon
intended use, but is often expressible as a sum of terms of the type
(f - h)2 / h where f is an observed frequency and h is its hypothetical
value.
