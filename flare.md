    Flares may appear within minutes and fade within an hour. They cover
    a wide range of intensity and size, and they tend to occur between
    sunspots or over their penumbrae. Flares are related to radio
    fadeouts and terrestrial magnetic disturbances. Flares eject high
    energy protons which present a serious hazard to men in unshielded
    spacecraft. 2. Pyrotechnic devices used for signaling or to provide
    illumination. 3. An expansion at the end of a cylindrical body as at
    the base of a rocket.
