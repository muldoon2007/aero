# Definition

An electrical conductive gas comprised of neutral particles, ionized
particles, and free electrons but which, taken as a whole, is
electrically neutral. A plasma is further characterized by relatively
large intermolecular distances, large amounts of energy stored in the
internal energy levels of the particles, and the presence of a plasma
sheath at all boundaries of the plasma. Plasmas are sometimes referred
to as a fourth state of matter.
