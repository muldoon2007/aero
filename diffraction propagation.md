# Definition

Wave propagation around objects, or over the horizon, by diffraction.
Diffraction is due to the fact that from every point in a wave front a
spherical front is generated which falls off in intensity away from the
forward direction. A continuous series of such actions carries radiation
around objects, or around the curvature of the earth, but with rapidly
diminishing intensity.
