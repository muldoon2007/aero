# Definition

1.  An oscillation in pressure, stress, particle displacement, particle
    velocity, etc., in a medium with internal forces (e.g., elastic,
    viscous), or the superposition of such propagated oscillations. 2. A
    sensation evoked by the oscillation described above in the human
    ear. In case of possible confusion, the term sound wave or elastic
    wave may be used for concept 1 and the term sound sensation for
    concept 2. Not all sound wave can evoke an auditory sensation, e.g.,
    ultrasound. The medium in which the sound exists is often indicated
    by an appropriate adjective, e.g., airborne, water borne, structure
    borne.
