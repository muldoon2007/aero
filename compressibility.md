# Definition

1.  The property of a substance, as air, by virtue of which its density
    increases with increase in pressure. 2. = coefficient of
    compressibility. In aerodynamics, this property of the air is
    manifested especially at high speeds (speeds approaching that of
    sound and higher speeds). Compressibility of the air about an
    aircraft may give rise to buffeting, aileron buzz, shifts in trim,
    and other phenomena not ordinarily encountered at low speeds, known
    generally as compressibility effects.
