# Definition

A garment designed to provide pressure upon the body so that respiratory
and circulatory functions may continue normally, or nearly so, under
low-pressure conditions, such as occur at high altitudes or in space
without benefit of a pressurized cabin. A pressure suit is distinguished
from a pressurized suit, which inflates, although it may be fitted with
inflating parts that tighten the garment as ambient pressure decreases.
Compare g-suit.
