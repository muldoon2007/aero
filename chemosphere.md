# Definition

The vaguely defined region of the upper atmosphere in which
photochemical reactions take place. It is generally considered to
include the stratosphere (or the top thereof) and the mesosphere, and
sometimes the lower part of the thermosphere. See atmospheric shell.
This entire region is the seat of a number of important photochemical
reactions involving atomic oxygen O, molecular oxygen O2, ozone O3,
hydroxyl OH, nitrogen N2, sodium Na, and other constituents to a lesser
degree.
