# Definition

In statistics, a range of values which is believed to include, with a
preassigned degree of confidence (confidence level), the true
characteristic of the lot or universe a given percentage of the time.
For example: 95-percent confidence limits for a sample of 10 with a
ratio of successes to total number tested of 0.9 (9 successes and 1
failure) would be 0.54 to 1.0. That is, even with an observed success
ratio of 0.9 (90 percent) the best that can be said is that the true
ratio lies between 0.54 (54 percent) and 1.0 (100 percent) an estimated
95 percent of the time.
