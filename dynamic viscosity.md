# Definition

Of a fluid, the ratio of the shearing stress to the shear of the motion.
It is independent of the velocity distribution, the dimensions of the
system, etc., and for a gas it is independent of pressure except at very
low pressures. Also called coefficient of molecular viscosity,
coefficient of viscosity. For the dynamic viscosity � of a perfect gas,
the kinetic theory of gases gives where is the gas density, c is the
average speed of the random heat motion of the gas molecules and is
proportional to the square root of the temperature, and is the mean free
path. For dry air at 0� C, the dynamic viscosity is about 1.7 \* 10-4
gram per centimeter per second. Whereas the dynamic viscosity of most
gases increases with increasing temperature, that of most liquids,
including water, decreases rapidly with increasing temperature.
