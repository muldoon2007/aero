# Definition

According to the quantum theory of radiation, the elementary quantity,
or quantum, of radiant energy. It is regarded as a discrete quantity
having a momentum equal to hv/c , where h is Planck constant, v is the
frequency of the radiation, and c is the speed of light in a vacuum. The
photon is never at rest, has no electric charge and no magnetic moment,
but does have a spin moment. The energy of a photon (the unit quantum of
energy) is equal to hv.
