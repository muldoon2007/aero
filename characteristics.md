# Definition

Lines or surfaces associated with a partial differential equation, or
with a set of such equations, which are at all points tangent to
characteristics directions, determined by certain specified linear
combinations of the equations. The use of these lines or surfaces may
facilitate the solution of the equations and is known as the method of
characteristics. The method has been particularly successful, for
example, in the problem of finite-amplitude expansion and shock waves.
