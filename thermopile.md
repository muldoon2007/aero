# Definition

1.  A transducer for converting thermal energy directly into electrical
    energy, composed of pairs of thermocouples which are connected
    either in series or in parallel. See Moll thermopile, Eppley
    pyrheliometer. 2. A battery of thermocouples connected in series to
    form a single compact unit. The output voltage of N pairs of
    series-connected thermocouples is N time the voltage developed by a
    single pair, whereas the current developed by N pairs of
    parallel-connected thermocouples is N times the current developed by
    a single pair. Thermopiles are used in thermoelectric radiation
    instruments when the output of a single pair of thermocouples is not
    large enough.
