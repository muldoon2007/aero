# Definition

1.  One of two or more nuclides having the same mass number A and atomic
    number Z, but existing for measurable times in different quantum
    states with different energies and radioactive properties. The state
    of lowest energy is the ground state. Those of higher energies are
    metastable states. To indicate the metastable isomer, the letter m
    is added to the mass number in the symbol for the nuclide; thus
    Br80mCommonly, the isomer of higher energy decays to one with lower
    energy by the process of isometric transition. 2. One of two or more
    molecules having the same atomic composition and molecular weight,
    but differing in geometrical configuration.
