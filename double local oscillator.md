# Definition

An oscillator mixing system which generates two radio-frequency signals
accurately spaced a few hundred cycles apart and mixes these signals to
give the difference frequency which is used as the reference. This
equipment is used in an interferometer system to obtain a detectable
signal containing the phase information of an antenna pair and the
reference signal to allow removal of the phase data for use.
