# Definition

A flat round platform on which human and animal subjects can be placed
in various positions and rapidly rotated, much as on a phonograph
record, in order to simulate and study the effects of prolonged tumbling
at high rates. Complex types of tumbling can be simulated by mounting
the spin table on the arm of a centrifuge.
