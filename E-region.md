# Definition

The region of the ionosphere in which the E-layer tends to form. See
atmospheric shell. The E-layer has been observed to be subdivided into
two or more layers, and these are then assigned the designation, E1, E2,
etc. Patchy and intermittent clouds of fairly high ionization, known as
sporadic E-layers, also form in the same general region.
