# Definition

In atmospheric electricity, the number of ions per unit volume of a
given sample of air; more particularly, the number of ions of a given
type (positive small ion, negative small ion, positive large ion, etc.)
per unit volume of air. Also called ion concentration. Measurement of
ion density is used in determining efficiency of ionizers in ion
engines.
