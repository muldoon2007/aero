# Definition

A radio receiver which receives the reply from a transponder and
produces an output suitable for feeding to a display system. A responsor
is usually combined in a single unit with an interrogator, which sends
out the pulse that triggers a transponder, the combined unit being
called an interrogator-responsor.
