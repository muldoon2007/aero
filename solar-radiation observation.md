# Definition

An evaluation of the radiation from the sun that reaches the observation
point. The observing instrument is usually a pyrheliometer or
pyranometer. Two types of such observation are taken. The more common
consists of measurements of the radiation reaching a horizontal surface,
consisting of both radiation from the sun (direct solar radiation) and
that reaching the instrument indirectly by scattering in the atmosphere
(diffuse sky radiation). The other type of observation involves the use
of an equatorial mount that keeps the instrument pointed directly at the
sun at all times. The sensitive surface of the instrument is normal to
the path of the radiation and is shielded from indirect radiation from
the sky.
