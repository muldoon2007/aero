    temperature only. Compare reflection, transmission. See emittance,
    emissivity. 2. With respect to electric propulsion and energy
    conversion, the sending out of charged particles from a surface
    causing the generation of these particles; e.g., emission of ions
    from an ionizing surface in ion engines.
