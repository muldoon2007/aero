# Definition

A continuous-wave trajectory measuring system which utilizes the Doppler
effect to measure the distances between a transmitter, a rocket
transponder, and several receiving stations. From these measurements
trajectory data are computed. In contrast to less sophisticated systems,
Doran obviates the necessity of continuously recording the Doppler
signal by making simultaneous distance measurements with four different
frequencies.
