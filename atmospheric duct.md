# Definition

An almost horizontal layer in the troposphere, extending from the level
of a local minimum of the modified refractive index as a function of
height, down to the level where the minimum value is again encountered,
or down to earth's surface if the minimum value is not encountered
again. Atmospheric ducts may act as waveguides for radio and radar
waves.
