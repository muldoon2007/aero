# Definition

1.  In astrophysics, the temperature of a black body radiating the same
    amount of energy per unit area at the wavelengths under
    consideration as the observed body. Compare effective temperature,
    antenna temperature. 2. The temperature of a nonblack body
    determined by measurement with an optical pyrometer.
