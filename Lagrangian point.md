# Definition

One of the five solutions by Lagrange to the three-body problem in which
three bodies will move as a stable configuration. In three of the
solutions the bodies are in line; in the other two the bodies are at the
vortices of equilateral triangles. Lagrange predicted in 1772 that if
the three bodies form an equilateral triangle revolving about one of the
bodies, the system would be stable. This prediction was fulfilled in
1908 with the discovery of the asteroid Achilles approximately 60
degrees ahead of Jupiter in Jupiter's orbit. Since then other asteroids
have been discovered 60 degrees ahead and 60 degrees behind Jupiter.
