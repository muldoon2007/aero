# Definition

A measure of the direction of propagation of electromagnetic radiation
upon arrival at a receiver (most commonly used in radio). It is the
angle between the plane of the phase front and some plane of reference,
usually the horizontal, at the receiving antenna. This angle is a
function of the index of refraction gradient of the medium through which
the energy is traveling, and the relative positions of the transmitter
and receiver. Compare angle of incidence. Angles of arrival can be
measured for both the direct and reflected components of a wave using a
multiple-antenna receiving system called an interferometer .
