# Definition

The extent to which a carrier frequency (or when a carrier is not
present, a frequency coinciding with the center of an emission
bandwidth) is permitted to depart, solely because of frequency
instability, from the authorized carrier frequency (or when a carrier is
not present from the assigned frequency).
