# Definition

Finely divided solid matter with particle sizes smaller than a
micrometeorite, thus with diameters much smaller than a millimeter,
moving in interplanetary space. See dust. Cosmic dust in the solar
system is thought to be concentrated in the plane of the ecliptic, thus
causing the zodiacal light.
