# Definition

Of the earth, the ratio of the difference between the equatorial radius
(major semiaxis) and the polar radius (minor semiaxis) of the earth to
the equatorial radius. Also called compression. See astronomical
constants. The flattening of the earth is the ellipticity of the
spheroid and equals the ellipticity of the ellipse forming a meridional
section the spheroid. If a and b represent the major and minor semiaxes
of the spheroid, and f is the flattening of the earth, f = (a - b) / a
The magnitude of the flattening is sometimes expressed by stating the
numerical value of the reciprocal of the flattening, a/(a - b).
