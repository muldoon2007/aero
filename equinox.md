# Definition

1.  One of the two points of intersection of the ecliptic and the
    celestial equator, occupied by the sun when its declination is 0ï¿½.
    Also called equinoctial point. That point occupied on or about March
    21, when the sun's declination changes from south to north, is
    called vernal equinox, March equinox, or first point of Aries; that
    point occupied on or about September 23, when the declination
    changes from north to south, is called autumnal equinox, September
    equinox, or first point of Libra. Equinox is often used to mean
    vernal equinox, when referring to the origin of measurement of right
    ascension and celestial longitude. 2. That instant the sun occupies
    one of the equinoctial points.
