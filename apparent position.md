# Definition

The position on the celestial sphere at which a heavenly body (or a
space vehicle) would be seen from the center of the earth at a
particular time. Compare astrometric position. The apparent position of
a body is displaced from the true position at the time of observation by
the motion of the body during the time it takes light to travel from the
body to the earth (see planetary aberration) and by aberration. Most
ephemerides tabulate apparent position of the sun, moon, and planets.
