# Definition

A mathematically defined thermodynamic function of state h = u + pv
where h is specific enthalpy; u is specific internal energy; p is
pressure; and v is specific volume. Also called heat function. The
change in enthalpy measures the heat imparted to a system during a
reversible isobaric process: dh = dq where dq is the heat increment per
unit mass. For a perfect gas, dh = cpdT where cp is the specific heat at
constant pressure and dT is the temperature increment.
