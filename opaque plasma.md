# Definition

A plasma through which an electromagnetic wave cannot propagate and is
either absorbed or reflected. In general, a plasma is opaque for
frequencies below the plasma frequency. The fact that a plasma is opaque
over a certain frequency range will change the radiation properties
within that frequency range. Any radiation emitted within the volume of
the plasma is quickly absorbed. In this opaque region, therefore, the
plasma can only radiate from its surface.
