# Definition

1.  The mixture of gases comprising the earth's atmosphere. The percent
    by volume of those gases found in relatively constant amount in dry
    air near sea level in very nearly as follows: ELEMENT % nitrogen
    (N2) 78.084 oxygen (O2) 20.9476 argon (A) 0.934 carbon dioxide (CO2)
    0.0314 (variable) neon (Ne) 0.001818 helium (He) 0.000524 methane
    (CH4) 0.0002 (variable) krypton (Kr) 0.000114 hydrogen (H2) 0.00005
    nitruous oxide (N2O) 0.00005 xenon (Xe) 0.0000087 This table is from
    the 1965 edition of the Aerospace Dictionary. In addition to the
    above constituents there are many variable constituents. Chief of
    these is water vapor, which may vary from zero to volume percentages
    close to 4 percent. Ozone, sulfur dioxide, ammonia, carbon monoxide,
    iodine, and other trace gases occur in small and varying amounts.
    The above composition of dry air is true to about 90 kilometers. See
    upper atmosphere. 2. The realm or medium in which aircraft operate.
