# Definition

By international agreement, a period during which greatly increased
observation of worldwide geophysical phenomena is undertaken through the
cooperative effort of participating nations. July 1957 to December 1958
was the first such year; however, precedent was set by the International
Polar Years of 1882 and 1932.
