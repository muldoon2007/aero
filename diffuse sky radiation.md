# Definition

Solar radiation reaching the earth's surface after having been scattered
from the direct solar beam by molecules or suspensoids in the
atmosphere. Also called skylight, diffuse skylight, sky radiation. Of
the total light removed from the direct solar beam by scattering in the
atmosphere (approximately 25 percent of the incident radiation), about
two-thirds ultimately reaches the earth as diffuse sky radiation.
