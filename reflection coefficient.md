# Definition

A measure of the quality of specular reflection produced by a given
surface; defined as the ratio of the radiant energy reflected along the
geometrical reflection path to the total that is incident upon the
surface. By definition, a reflection coefficient of 1.0 implies perfect
specular reflection. Compare reflectivity. Reflection coefficients of
less than 1.0 occur either as a result of energy loss by absorption at
the reflection surface, or by scattering of the energy out of the
geometrical reflection path due to the diffuse or irregular nature of
the reflecting surface. Note that the reflection coefficient varies with
wavelength since a surface which might appear to be rough at very short
wavelengths is much smoother to longer wavelength radiation. It also
varies with polarization.
