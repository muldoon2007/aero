# Definition

An optical instrument which consists of a sighting telescope, mounted so
that it is free to rotate around horizontal and vertical axes, and
graduated scales so that the angle of rotation may be measured. The
telescope is usually fitted with a right-angle prism so that the
observer continues to look horizontally into the eyepiece, whatever the
variation of the elevation angle.
