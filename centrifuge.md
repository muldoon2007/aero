# Definition

Specifically, a large motor-driven apparatus with a long arm at the end
of which human and animal subjects or equipment can be revolved and
rotated at various speeds to simulate (very closely) the (prolonged)
accelerations encountered in high-performance aircraft, rockets, and
spacecraft. Sometimes called astronautic centrifuge.
