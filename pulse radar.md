# Definition

A type of radar, designed to facilitate range measurement, in which the
transmitted energy is emitted in periodic short pulses. Also called
pulsed radar. Compare continuous-wave radar. The distance to any target
a detectable echo can be determined by measuring one-half the time
interval between transmitted pulse and received echo and multiplying
this number by the speed of light. This is by far the most common type
of radar.
