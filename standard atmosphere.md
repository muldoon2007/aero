# Definition

1.  A hypothetical vertical distribution of atmospheric temperature,
    pressure, and density which, by international agreement, is taken to
    be representative of the atmosphere (see Table XV ) for purposes of
    pressure altimeter calibrations, aircraft performance calculations,
    aircraft and rocket design, ballistic tables, etc. The air is
    assumed to be devoid of dust, moisture, and water vapor and to obey
    the perfect gas law and the hydrostatic equation (the air is static
    with respect to the earth). Standard atmospheres, sense 1, which
    have been used are: (a) The NACA standard atmosphere, also called
    U.S. standard atmosphere, prepared in 1925, which was supplanted
    by (b) The ICAO standard atmosphere, adopted in 1952, which was
    extended to greater altitudes by (c) The ARDC model atmosphere,
    1956, and (d) The U.S. extension to the ICAO standard atmosphere,
    adopted in 1956, which has been revised by (e) The ARDC model
    atmosphere, 1959, which incorporated some satellite data which has
    been supplanted by (f) The U.S. Standard Atmosphere-1962. (See Table
    XV ). 2. (abbr atm). A standard unit of atmospheric pressure,
    defined as that pressure exerted by a 760-millimeter column of
    mercury at standard gravity (980.665 centimeters per second per
    second) at temperature 0 degrees C. 1 standard atmosphere = 760
    millimeters of mercury; = 29.9213 inches of mercury; = 1013.250
    millibars.
