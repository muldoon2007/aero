The change in frequency with which energy reaches a receiver when the
receiver and the energy source are in motion relative to each other.
Also called Doppler shift. In the case of sound, or any other wave
motion where a real medium of propagation exists (excepting,
therefore, light and other electromagnetic radiations) one must
distinguish two principal cases: If the source is in motion with speed
vs relative to a medium which propagates the waves in question at
speed c, then the resting observer, moving at speed vr relative to the
medium, receives waves emitted, with actual frequency f as if they had
a frequency f' given by the Doppler equation $$f' = f \left(\frac{c \pm v_r}{c \pm v_s}\right)$$

$v_r$ is the speed of the receiver relative to the medium, added to c
if the receiver is moving towards the source, subtracted if the
receiver is moving away from the source

$v_s$ is the speed of the source relative to the medium, added to c if
the source is moving away the receiver, subtracted if the receiver is
moving towards from the receiver
