# Definition

The change in frequency with which energy reaches a receiver when the
receiver and the energy source are in motion relative to each other.
Also called Doppler shift. In the case of sound, or any other wave
motion where a real medium of propagation exists (excepting, therefore,
light and other electromagnetic radiations) one must distinguish two
principal cases: If the source is in motion with speed v relative to a
medium which propagates the waves in question at speed c, then the
resting observer receives waves emitted, with actual frequency f as if
they had a frequency f' given by the Doppler equation f ' = f/\[1 �
(v/c)\] where the positive sign refers to the case of the source
receding from the observer, and the vice versa for the negative sign.
If, on the other hand, the source is at rest relative to the propagating
medium while the observer moves with speed v relative to the source, f '
= f '\[1� (v/c)\] where the positive sign now refers to the case of
observer approaching the source. For electromagnetic radiation, f/f ' =
\[1 (v/c)\]/\[1 � (v/c)\] where the top signs represent the source
receding from the observer and the bottom signs, approaching the
observer.
