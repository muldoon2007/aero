# Definition

One of two general classes of radar indicators, in which the sweep of
the electron beam is deflected vertically or horizontally from a base
line to indicate the existence of an echo from a target. The amount of
deflection is usually a function of the echo signal strength. Also
called deflection-modulated indicator . Compare intensity modulated
indicator.
