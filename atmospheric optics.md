The study of the optical characteristics of the atmosphere and of the
optical phenomena produced by the atmosphere's suspensoids and
hydrometeors. It embraces the study of refraction, reflection,
diffraction, scattering, and polarization of light, but is not commonly
regarded as including the study of any other kinds of radiation. Also
called meteorological optics.
