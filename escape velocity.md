# Definition

The radial speed which a particle or larger body must attain in order to
escape from the gravitational field of a planet or star. When friction
is neglected, the escape velocity is where G is the universal
gravitational constant (see gravitation); m is the mass of the planet or
star; and r is the radial distance from the center of the planet or
star. Also called escape speed. Escape velocity from Earth is 7
miles/sec; from Mars it is 3.2 miles/sec; and from the Sun it is 390
miles/sec. In order for a celestial body to retain an atmosphere for
long periods of time, the mean velocity of the atmospheric molecules
must be considerably below the escape velocity.
