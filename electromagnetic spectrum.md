# Definition

The ordered array of known electromagnetic radiations, extending from
the shortest cosmic rays, through gamma rays, X-rays, ultraviolet
radiation, visible radiation, infrared radiation, and including
microwave and all other wavelengths of radio energy. See absorption
spectrum. The division of this continuum of wavelengths (or frequencies)
into a number of named subportions is rather arbitrary and, with one or
two exceptions, the boundaries of the several subportions are only
vaguely defined. Nevertheless, to each of the commonly identified
subportions there correspond characteristic types of physical systems
capable of emitting radiation of those wavelengths. Thus, gamma rays are
emitted from the nuclei of atoms as they undergo any of several types of
nuclear rearrangements; visible light is emitted, for the most part, by
atoms whose planetary electrons are undergoing transitions to lower
energy states; infrared radiations are associated with characteristic
molecular vibrations and rotations; and radio waves, broadly speaking,
are emitted by virtue of the accelerations of free electrons as, for
example, the moving electrons in a radio antenna wire.
