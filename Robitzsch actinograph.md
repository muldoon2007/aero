A pyranometer developed by M. Robitzsch. Its design utilizes three
bimetallic strips which are exposed horizontally at the center of a
hemispherical glass bowl. The outer strips are white reflectors, and the
center strip is a blackened absorber. The bimetals are joined in such a
manner that the pen of the instrument deflects in proportion to the
difference in temperature between the black and white strips.
