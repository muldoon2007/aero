# Definition

That portion of the earth's atmosphere, above the planetary boundary
layer, in which the effect of the earth's surface friction on the air
motion is negligible, and in which the air is usually treated
(dynamically) as an ideal fluid. The base of the free atmosphere is
usually taken as the geostrophic wind level. Also called free air.
