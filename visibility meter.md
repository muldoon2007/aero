# Definition

The general term for instruments used to make direct measurements of
visual range in the atmosphere or of the physical characteristics of the
atmosphere which determine the visual range. Visibility meters may be
classified according to the quantities that they measure.
Telephotometers and transmissometers measure the transmissivity or
alternatively, the extinction coefficient of the atmosphere.
Nephelometers measure the scattering function of the atmospheric
suspensoids. A third category of visibility meters makes use of an
artificial haze of variable density which is used to obscure a marker at
a fixed distance from the meter.
