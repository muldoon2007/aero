# Definition

A line of constant potential temperature on a thermodynamic diagram. In
terms of pressure p , and specific volume v , the equation for a dry
adiabat may be written pvcp /cv = Constant where cp and cv are the
specific heats of dry air at constant pressure and volume, respectively.
Meteorologically, the dry adiabat is intended to represent the lifting
of dry air in a dry-adiabatic process. Since this is also an isentropic
process, a dry adiabat is an isentrope.
