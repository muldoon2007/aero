# Definition

A luminous, gaseous, electrical discharge in which the charge transfer
occurs continuously along a narrow channel of high ion density. An arc
discharge requires a continuous source of electric potential difference
across the terminals of the arc. Arc discharge is to be distinguished
from corona discharge, point discharge, and spark discharge.
