# Definition

The arc of the celestial equator, or the angle at the celestial pole,
between the lower branch of the local celestial meridian and the hour
circle of the mean sun, measured westward from the lower branch of the
local celestial meridian through 24 hours; local hour angle of the mean
sun, expressed in time units, plus 12 hours. Mean time reckoned from the
upper branch of the local meridian is called local astronomical time.
Local mean time at the Greenwich meridian is called Greenwich mean time,
or universal time. It was called local civil time in United States
terminology from 1925 through 1952.
