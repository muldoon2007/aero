# Definition

1.  A picture or image in which steep density gradients in the flow
    about a body are made visible, the body itself being presented in
    silhouette. 2. The optical method or technique by which this is
    done. A shadowgraph differs from a schlieren photograph in that the
    schlieren method depends on the first derivative of the refractive
    index while the shadow method depends on the second derivative.
    Interference measurements give the refractive index directly.
