# Definition

A transverse wave in a magnetohydrodynamic field in which the driving
force is the tension introduced by the magnetic field along the lines of
force. Also called magnetohydrodynamic wave . The dynamics of such waves
are analogous to those in a vibrating string, the phase speed C being
given by where u is the permeability; H is the magnitude of the magnetic
field; and p is the fluid density. Dissipative effects due to fluid
viscosity and electrical resistance may be also present.
