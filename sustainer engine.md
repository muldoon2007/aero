# Definition

A rocket engine that maintains the velocity of a rocket vehicle once it
has achieved its programmed velocity by use of booster or other engine.
This term is applied, for example, to the remaining engine of the Atlas
after the two booster engines have been jettisoned. The term is also
applied to a rocket engine used on an orbital flider to provide the
small amount of thrust now and then required to compensate for the drag
imparted by air particles in the upper atmosphere.
