# Definition

The trapping of an electromagnetic wave, in a waveguide action, between
two layers of the atmosphere, or between a layer of the atmosphere and
the earth's surface. See refractivity, total refraction. Ducting is
likely to occur where the gradient of the index of refraction exceeds 48
N-units per 1000 feet of altitude.
