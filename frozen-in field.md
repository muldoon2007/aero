# Definition

1.  A magnetohydrodynamic field in a medium of negligible electrical
    resistance, in which the motion of the material is along the lines
    of magnetic force, which are thereby constant or frozen. 2. The
    entrapment of magnetic field lines by a perfectly conducting fluid.
    If a magnetic field is somehow established in a fluid with infinite
    conductivity, a motion of the fluid will carry the field lines and
    hence the field energy with it. If the fluid is compressed, the
    field will be compressed and if turbulence occurs in the fluid, the
    field will become badly twisted.
