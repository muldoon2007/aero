1.  An attendant body that revolves about another body, the primary;
    especially in the solar system, a secondary body, or moon, that
    revolves about a planet. See table XIII for a list of satellites of
    the solar system. 2. A manmade object that revolves about a spatial
    body, such as Explorer I orbiting about the earth. See spacecraft,
    Table XIV. 3. Such a body intended and designed for orbiting, as
    distinguished from a companion body that may incidentally also
    orbit, as in the observer actually saw the orbiting rocket rather
    than the satellite. 4. An object not yet placed in orbit, but
    designed or expected to be launched into an orbit.
