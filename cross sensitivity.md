# Definition

The ratio of change in output to an incremental change in a given
stimulus along any axis perpendicular to the sensitive axis. In
accelerometers it refers to the change in the transducer output at zero
acceleration and at some other acceleration value applied along a plane
perpendicular to the sensitive axis.
