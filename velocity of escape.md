# Definition

The initial speed an object, particularly a molecule of gas, must have
at the surface of a celestial body to overcome the gravitational pull
and proceed out into space without returning to the celestial body. Also
called escape velocity, escape speed. The velocity of escape determines
a body's ability to retain an atmosphere. The velocity of escape on the
surface of the earth is nearly 7 miles per second, neglecting air
resistance.
