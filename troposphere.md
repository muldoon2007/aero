# Definition

That portion of the atmosphere from the earth's surface to the
stratosphere; that is, the lowest 10 to 20 kilometers of the atmosphere.
The troposphere is characterized by decreasing temperature with height,
appreciable vertical wind motion, appreciable water vapor content, and
weather. Dynamically, the troposphere can be divided into the following
layers: surface boundary layer, Ekamn layer, and free atmosphere. See
atmospheric shell.
