# Definition

1.  The science that deals with the motion of air and other gaseous
    fluids, and of the forces acting on bodies when the bodies move
    through such fluids, or when such fluids move against or around the
    bodies, as, his research in aerodynamics . 2. (a) The actions and
    forces resulting from the movement or flow of gaseous fluids against
    or around bodies, as, the aerodynamics of a wing in supersonic
    flight . (b) The properties of a body or bodies with respect to
    these actions or forces, as, the aerodynamics of a turret or of a
    configuration . 3. The application of the principles of gaseous
    fluid flows and of their actions against and around bodies to the
    design and construction of bodies intended to move through such
    fluids, as a design used in aerodynamics.
