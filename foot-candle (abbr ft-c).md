# Definition

A unit of illuminance, incident light, or illumination equal to 1 lumen
per square foot. This is the illuminance provided by a light source of
one candle at a distance of 1 foot, hence the name. Compare lux, phot.
Full sunlight with zenith sun produces an illuminance of the order of
10,000 foot-candles on a horizontal surface at the earth's surface. Full
moonlight provides an illuminance of only about 0.02 foot-candle also at
earth's surface. Adequate illumination for steady reading is taken to be
about 10 foot-candles; that for close machine work is about 30 to 40
foot-candles.
