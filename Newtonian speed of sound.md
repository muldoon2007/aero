# Definition

An approximation to the speed of sound a in a perfect gas given by the
relation a2 = p / ρ where p is pressure and ρ is density. Compare
Laplacian speed of sound. See acoustic velocity. Newton derived this
expression by assuming the propagation of sound to be an isothermal
process. It leads to values about 16 percent below those observed.
