# Definition

1.  The elements of the orbits of the bodies of the solar system, their
    masses relative to the sun, their size, shape, orientation,
    rotation, and inner constitution, and the velocity of light. 2. =
    system of astronomical constants. The astronomical constants used in
    the calculations of The American Ephemeris and Nautical Almanac, as
    well as other national ephemerides, were adopted at various times
    between 1896 and 1930. Although the system was known to contain many
    inconsistencies, the International Astronomical Union recommended
    their continued use in 1952. Space-related research has provided
    data for the computation of a more accurate system, and in January
    1964 The Working Group on the System of Astronomical Constants
    recommended a new system of constants to be introduced into the
    national and international ephemerides at the earliest practicable
    date. Both the conventional and revised systems are given in
    Table II. The constants in Table III were recommended for use in
    trajectory calculations for NASA programs by the Ad Hoc NASA
    Standards Constants Committee May 16, 1963.
