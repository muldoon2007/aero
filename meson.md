# Definition

In the classification of a subatomic particles by mass, the second
lightest of such particles. Its mass is intermediate between that of the
lepton and the nucleon (see hyperon). Mesons are highly unstable, very
short-lived particles; they carry positive, negative, or no charge, and,
in a vacuum, move with velocities approaching the speed of light. All of
these particles have extremely short lifetimes and the heavier more
unstable mesons tend to decay into lighter ones.
