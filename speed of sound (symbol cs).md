# Definition

The speed of propagation of sound waves. In the atmosphere cs = \[γ
(R\*/M0)TM\]1/2 where γ is the ratio of specific heat of air at constant
pressure to that a constant volume, R\* is the universal gas constant,
M0 is the mean molecular weight of air at sea level, and TM is the
molecular scale temperature. At sea level in the standard atmosphere,
the speed of sound is 340.294 meters per second (1116.45 feet per
second). The concept of the speed of sound in the atmosphere loses its
applicability at about 90 kilometers where the mean of free path of air
molecules approaches the wavelengths of sound waves.
