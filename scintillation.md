# Definition

1.  Generic term for rapid variations in apparent position, brightness,
    or color of a distant luminous object viewed through the atmosphere.
    If the object lies outside the earth's atmosphere, as in the case of
    stars and planets, the phenomenon is termed astronomical
    scintillation; if the luminous source lies within the atmosphere,
    the phenomenon is termed terrestrial scintillation. As one of the
    three principal factors governing astronomical seeing, scintillation
    is defined as variations in luminance only. It is clearly
    established that almost all scintillation effects are caused by
    anomalous refraction occurring in rather small parcels or strata of
    air, schlieren, whose temperatures and hence densities differ
    slightly from those of their surroundings. Normal wind motions
    transporting such schlieren across the observer's line of sight
    produce the irregular fluctuations characteristic of scintillation.
    Scintillation effects are always much more pronounced near the
    horizon than near the zenith. Parcels of the order of only
    centimeters to decimeters are believed to produce most of the
    scintillatory irregularities in the atmosphere. 2. A flash of light
    produced in a phosphor by an ionizing event. See scintillation
    counter. 3. On a radar display, a rapid apparent displacement of the
    target from its mean position. Also called target glint or wander.
    This includes but is not limited to shift of effective reflection
    point on the target.
