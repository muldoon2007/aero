# Definition

The loss of radio energy due to the passage through a volume of the
atmosphere containing precipitation. Part of the energy is lost by
scattering and part by absorption. See cloud attenuation, range
attenuation. Radars operating at wavelengths of 10 centimeters and
higher are generally unaffected, whereas even the smallest precipitation
rates will seriously attenuate radar energy of wavelengths less than 1
centimeter. For rain and snow diameter-to-wavelength ratios less than
0.07, the loss is due primarily to absorption. Scattering becomes
important for ratios near 0.1 and greater. Attenuation by dry snow is
small for most radar wavelengths.
