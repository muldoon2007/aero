# Definition

The classical form (still widely used in engineering work) of the
definite integral of the special normal distribution for which the mean
μ = 0 and standard deviation σ = 1/21/2. Geometrically, the probability
integral equals the area under this density curve between -z and z ,
where z is an arbitrary positive number. Often denoted by the symbol erf
z (read error function of z ) the probability integral is defined thus:
Also called error function, erf.
