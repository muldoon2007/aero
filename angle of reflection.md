# Definition

The angle at which a reflected ray of energy leaves a reflecting
surface, measured between the direction of the outgoing ray and a
perpendicular to the surface at the point of reflection. Compare angle
of incidence. In some cases involving radio waves, the angle of
reflection is measured relative to the surface.
