# Definition

In general, the measure of the efficiency of a radar target in
intercepting and returning a radar signal. It depends upon the size,
shape, aspect, and the dielectric properties at the surface of the
target. It includes the effects of not only reflection (see
reflectivity) but also scattering and diffraction.
