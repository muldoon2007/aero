# Definition

1.  The four physical laws which, together, fundamentally describe the
    behavior of black-body radiation: (a) the Kirchhoff law is
    essentially a thermodynamic relationship between emission and
    absorption of any given wavelength at a given temperature; (b) the
    Planck law describes the variation of intensity of black-body
    radiation at a given temperature, as a function of wavelength; (c)
    the Stefan-Boltzmann law relates the time rate of radiant energy
    emission from a black body to its absolute temperature; (d) the Wien
    law relates the wavelength of maximum intensity emitted by a black
    body to its absolute temperature. 2. All the more inclusive
    assemblage of empirical and theoretical laws describing all
    manifestations of radiative phenomena; e.g., Bouguer law and Lambert
    law.
