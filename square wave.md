# Definition

1.  An oscillation, the amplitude of which shows periodic
    discontinuities between two values, remaining constant between
    jumps. 2. Specifically, in radar a pulse initiated by a rapid rise
    to peak power, maintained at a constant peak power over the finite
    pulse length, and terminated by rapid decrease from peak power.
