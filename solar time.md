# Definition

Time based upon the rotation of the earth relative to the sun. Solar
time may be designated as mean or astronomical if the mean sun is the
reference, or apparent if the apparent sun is the reference. The
difference between mean and apparent time is called equation of time.
Solar time may be further designated according to the reference
meridian, either the local or Greenwich meridian or additionally in the
case of mean time, a designated zone meridian. Standard or
daylight-saving are variations of zone time. Time may also be designated
according to the timepiece, as chronometer time or watch time, the time
indicated by these instruments.
