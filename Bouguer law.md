# Definition

A relationship describing the rate of decrease of flux density of a
plane-parallel beam of monochromatic radiation as it penetrates a medium
which both scatters and absorbs at that wavelength. This law may be
expressed or where I is the flux density of the radiation; is the
attenuation coefficient (or extinction coefficient) of the medium at
wavelength ; is the flux density at the source; and x is the distance
from the source. Sometimes called Beer law, Lambert law of absorption .
See absorption coefficient, scattering coefficient.
