# Definition

The star at the center of the solar system, around which the planets,
planetoids, and comets revolve. It is a G-type star. The sun visible in
the sky is called apparent or true sun. A fictitious sun conceived to
move eastward along the celestial equator at a rate that provides a
uniform measure of time equal to the average apparent time is called
mean sun; a fictitious sun conceived to move eastward along the ecliptic
at the average rate of the apparent sun is called dynamical mean sun.
