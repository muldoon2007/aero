# Definition

1.  A general term used to denote an increase in signal power or signal
    strength in transmission from one point to another. Gain is usually
    expressed in decibels and is widely used to denote transducer
    gain. 2. An increase or amplification. In radar there are two
    general usages of the term: (a) antenna gain, or gain factor, is the
    ratio of the power transmitted along the beam axis to that of an
    isotropic radiator transmitting the same total power; (b) receiver
    gain, or video gain, is the amplification given a signal by the
    receiver. See height gain.
