# Definition

1.  A measure of the extent to which the energy of a system is
    unavailable. A mathematically defined thermodynamic function of
    state, the increase in which gives a measure of the energy of a
    system which has ceased to be available for work during a certain
    process: ds = (du + pdv)/T \>= dq/T where s is specific entropy; u
    is specific internal energy; p is pressure; v is specific volume; T
    is Kelvin temperature; and q is heat per unit mass. For reversible
    processes, ds = dq/T In terms of potential temperature , ds = cp
    (d/) where cp is the specific heat at constant pressure. See third
    law of thermodynamics. In an adiabatic process, the entropy
    increases if the process is irreversible and remains unchanged if
    the process is reversible. Thus, since all natural processes are
    irreversible, it is said that in an isolated system the entropy is
    always increasing as the system tends toward equilibrium, a
    statement which may be considered a form of the second law of
    thermodynamics. 2. In communication theory, average information
    content.
