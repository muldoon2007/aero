# Definition

The return of waves out of a medium or layer, due to refraction. Total
refraction occurs most readily at low elevation angles. For any suitable
layer in the atmosphere, there is a critical beam elevation angle below
which total refraction can occur. In the ionosphere this angle is
frequency dependent.
