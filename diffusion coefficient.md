# Definition

The absolute value of the ratio of the molecular flux per unit area to
the concentration gradient of a gas diffusing through a gas or a porous
medium where the molecular flux is evaluated across a surface
perpendicular to the direction of the concentration gradient. See
diffusion, coefficient of mutual diffusion.
