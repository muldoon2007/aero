# Definition

A two-dimensional circular flow in which a circular region about the
origin is in solid rotation: V/R = Constant where V is the tangential
speed and R is the distance from the origin; the region outside is free
of vorticity, the speed being inversely proportional to the distance
from the origin (as in the V-R vortex) VR = Constant. This vortex has
occasionally been used as a model for the surface wind distribution in a
hurricane. It is characteristic of a cylindrical vortex in a liquid with
a free surface.
