# Definition

A line whose tangent at any point in a fluid is parallel to the
instantaneous velocity vector of the fluid at that point. The
differential equations of the streamlines may be written dr X v = 0,
where dr is an element of the streamline and v is the velocity vector;
or in Cartesian coordinates, dx / u = dy /v = dz /w, where u, v, w, are
the fluid velocities along the orthogonal X, Y, Z axes, respectively. In
steady-state flow the streamlines coincide with the trajectories of the
fluid particles; otherwise, the streamline pattern changes with time.
See free streamline. Compare trajectory.
