# Definition

By the International Gravity Formula, g = 978.0495 \[1 + 0.0052892
sin2(p) - 0.0000073 sin2 (2p)\] centimeters per second squared at sea
level at latitude p. See gravity. The standard value of gravity, or
normal gravity, g, is defined as g o =980.665 centimeters per second
squared, or 32.1741 feet per second squared. This value corresponds
closely to the International Gravity Formula value of g at 45Â° latitude
at sea level.
