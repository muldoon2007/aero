# Definition

An idealized atmosphere consisting of only those particles, such as
molecules, that are smaller than about one-tenth the wavelength of all
radiation incident upon that atmosphere. In such an atmosphere, simple
Rayleigh scattering would prevail. This model atmosphere is amenable to
reasonably complete theoretical treatment, and hence has often served as
a useful starting point in description of the optical properties of
actual atmospheres. The polarization of skylight, for example, exhibits
almost none of the complexities found in the real atmosphere.
