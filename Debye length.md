# Definition

A theoretical length which describes the maximum separation at which a
given electron will be influenced by the electric field of a given
positive ion. Sometimes referred to as the Debye shielding distance or
plasma length. It is well known that charged particles interact through
their own electric fields. In addition, Debye has shown that the
attractive force between an electron and ion which would otherwise exist
for very large separations is indeed cut off for a critical separation
due to the presence of other positive and negative charges in between.
This critical separation or Debye length decreases for increased plasma
density.
