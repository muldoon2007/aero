# Definition

1.  The drag force between electrons and ions drifting with respect to
    each other. In a fully ionized plasma, collisions between electrons
    and ions are small angle Coulomb collisions and they produce a
    velocity-dependent drag force which is called dynamical friction. 2.
    Sliding friction, in contrast to static friction.
