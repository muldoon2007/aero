# Definition

A two-dimensional navigation system which provides azimuth and distance
to a fixed ground station for navigation in piloted aircraft. Distance
is determined by pulse interrogation of the ground station with time
comparison to the returned pulse. Azimuth is provided by comparison of a
continuous-wave audiosignal from pulse amplitudes to reference pulses.
