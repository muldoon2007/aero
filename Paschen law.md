# Definition

A theoretical relationship for the direct-current breakdown voltage of
two parallel-plane electrodes immersed in a gas as a function of the gas
pressure and electrode separation. This relationship predicts the
occurrence of a minimum breakdown voltage for a certain product of the
pressure times the separation. The phenomenon is well verified
experimentally and is referred to as the Paschen minimum. This minimum
voltage is on the order of 300 to 500 volts and, for a gas pressure of 1
millimeter of mercury, occurs at an electrode separation of 0.2 to 1
centimeter depending on the gas.
