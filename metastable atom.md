# Definition

An atom with an electron excited to an energy level where simple
radiation is forbidden and thus the atom is momentarily stable. See
forbidden line. The presence of these metastable atoms in a discharge is
the cause of several anomalous effects since in essence they are storing
energy which can be released to other particles upon collision. The
Penning effect is a result of the presence of metastable atoms.
