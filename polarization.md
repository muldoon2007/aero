# Definition

1.  The state of electromagnetic radiation when transverse vibrations
    take place in some regular manner, e.g., all in one plane, in a
    circle, in an ellipse, or in some other definite curve. Radiation
    may become polarized because of the nature of its emitting source,
    as is the case with many types of radar antennas, or because of some
    processes to which it is subjected after leaving its source, as that
    which results from the scattering of solar radiation as it passes
    through the earth's atmosphere. 2. With respect to particles in an
    electric field, the displacement of the charge centers within a
    particle in response to the electric force acting thereon. See
    polarizability. 3. The response of the molecules of a paramagnetic
    medium (such as iron) when subjected to a magnetic field. A
    right-handed polarized wave is defined as one receding from the
    observer and radiated by an electric vector rotating clockwise in a
    fixed plane that is in front of the observer and at right angles to
    the direction of propagation of the wave in question. Left-handed
    polarization is the rotation in a counter-clockwise manner. This
    recommended definition of circular (or elliptical) polarization
    sense is according to that of the Institute of Radio Engineers. The
    definition of classical physics is exactly the opposite.
