# Definition

The angle between the plane of the ecliptic (the plane of the earth's
orbit) and the plane of the celestial equator. The obliquity of the
ecliptic is computed from the following formula: 23 degrees 27 minutes
08.26 seconds - 0.4684 (t - 1900) seconds, where t is the year for which
the obliquity is desired.
