# Definition

The efficiency with which a nozzle converts the energy of the working
substance into kinetic energy, expressed as the ratio of the kinetic
energy of the jet leaving the nozzle to the kinetic energy of a
hypothetical ideal jet leaving an ideal nozzle using the same working
substance at the same initial state and under the same conditions of
velocity and expansion.
