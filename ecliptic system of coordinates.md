# Definition

A set of celestial coordinates based on the ecliptic as the primary
great circle. See coordinate, table. The points 90� from the ecliptic
are the north and south ecliptic poles. Angular distance north or south
of the ecliptic, analogous to latitude, is celestial latitude. Celestial
longitude is measured eastward along the ecliptic from the vernal
equinox through 360�.
