# Definition

A radio device for determining the distribution of virtual height with
frequency, and the critical frequencies of the various layers of the
ionosphere. A pulse at a certain frequency is transmitted vertically,
and the time for its return is recorded on an oscilloscope; another
pulse at a different frequency is then transmitted and timed. The
process is thus repeated until the entire frequency range of interest,
usually from 1 to 20 megacycles, has been explored.
