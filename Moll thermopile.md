# Definition

A thermopile used in some types of radiation instruments. Alternate
junctions of series-connected thermocouples are imbedded in a shielded
nonconducting plate having a large heat capacity. The remaining
junctions, which are blackened, are exposed directly to the radiation.
The voltage developed by the thermopile is proportional to the intensity
of radiation. See solarimeter.
