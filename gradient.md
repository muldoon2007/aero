# Definition

1.  The space rate of decrease of a function. Of a function in three
    space dimensions, the vector normal to surfaces of constant value of
    the function and directed toward decreasing values, with magnitude
    equal to the rate of decrease of the function in this direction. The
    gradient of a function f is denoted by -f (without the minus sign in
    the older literature), and is itself a function of both space and
    time. The ascendant is the negative of the gradient. See
    del-operator. 2. Often loosely used to denote the magnitude of the
    gradient or ascendant. 3. Either the rate of change of a quantity
    (as temperature, pressure, etc.) or a diagram or curve representing
    this.
