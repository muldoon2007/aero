# Definition

1.  The location or device from which energy emanates as a sound source,
    heat source , etc. 2. Specifically, in the mathematical
    representation of fluid flow, a hypothetical point or place from
    which fluid emanates. The strength of a source; the rate of mass
    flow of unit density across a curve enclosing the source is given by
    Q = 2Ï€ r vr where r is the distance from the source and vr is the
    radial speed. 3. Specifically, the device which supplies signal
    power to a transducer.
