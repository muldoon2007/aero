# Definition

A nondimensional number arising in the study of shearing flows of a
stratified fluid: NRi = gβ/(u/z)2 where g is the acceleration of
gravity; β is a representative vertical stability (commonly θ/θz, where
θ is potential temperature); and u/z a characteristic vertical shear. In
Richardson's original interpretation, the Richardson number is a
characteristic ratio of work done against gravitational stability to
energy transferred from mean to turbulent motion. Theoretical studies
have placed the critical Richardson number variously from 1/4 to 2, with
instability for smaller values and stability for greater.
