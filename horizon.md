# Definition

That great circle of the celestial sphere midway the zenith and nadir,
or a line resembling or approximating such a circle. That line where
earth and sky appear to meet, and the projection of this line upon the
celestial sphere, is called visible or apparent horizon. A line
resembling the visible horizon but above or below it is called a false
horizon. That circle of the celestial sphere formed by the intersection
of the celestial sphere and a plane perpendicular to the zenith-nadir
line is called sensible horizon if the plane is through any point, such
as the eye of an observer, geoidal horizon if through any sea-level
point, and celestial or rational horizon if through the center of the
earth. The geometrical horizon was originally considered identical with
the celestial sphere and an infinite number of straight lines tangent to
the earth's surface, and radiating from the eye of the observer. If
there were no terrestrial refraction, geometrical and visible horizons
would coincide. An artificial horizon is a gyroscopic instrument for
indicating the attitude of an aircraft with respect to the horizontal. A
radio horizon is the line at which direct rays from a transmitting
antenna become tangent to the earth's surface. A radar horizon is the
radio horizon of a radar antenna.
