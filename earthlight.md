# Definition

The illumination of the dark part of the moon's disk produced by
sunlight reflected onto the moon from the earth's surface and
atmosphere. Also called earthshine. Spectroscopic observations reveal
that earthlight is relatively richer in blue light than is direct
sunlight; this condition results from the fact that an appreciable part
of the total earth reflection is backward-scattered light which, in
accordance with Rayleigh law, is relatively rich in the blue and poor in
the red.
