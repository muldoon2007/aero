# Definition

Any scattering process produced by spherical particles whose radii are
smaller than about one-tenth the wavelength of the scattered radiation.
Compare Mie scattering. In Rayleigh scattering, the scattering
coefficient varies inversely with the fourth power of the wavelength, a
relation known as the Rayleigh law. The angular intensity polarization
relationships for Rayleigh scattering are conveniently simple. For
particles not larger than the Rayleigh limit, there is complete symmetry
of scattering about a plane normal to the direction of the incident
radiation, so that the forward scatter equals the backward scatter. The
Rayleigh scattering coefficient ks is where n is the number of scatters
of diameter d; m is the index of refraction; and Î» is the wavelength of
the radiation.
