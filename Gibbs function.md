- # Definition
  
  A mathematically defined thermodynamic function of state, which is
  constant during a reversible isobaric-isothermal process. Also called
  Gibbs free energy, thermodynamic potential. Compare Helmholtz function.
  In symbols the specific Gibbs function g is g = h - Ts where h is
  specific enthalpy; T is Kelvin temperature; and s is specific entropy.
  By use of the first law of thermodynamics for reversible processes, dg =
  -s dT + dp.
