# Definition

1.  The process of following the movements of an object. This may be
    done by keeping the reticle of an optical system or a radar beam on
    the object, by plotting its bearing and distance at frequent
    intervals, or by a combination of the two. 2. A motion given to the
    major lobe of an antenna so that a preassigned moving target in
    space remains in the lobe's field as long as it is within viewing
    range.
