# Definition

1.  An estimate of the temperature of an incandescent body, determined
    by observing the wavelength at which it is emitting with peak
    intensity (its color) and using that wavelength in Wien law. If such
    a body were an ideal black body, the temperature so estimated would
    be its true temperature and would also agree with its effective
    temperature; but for actual bodies, the color temperature is
    generally only an approximate value. Thus, the sun's color
    temperature is about 6100� K, a few hundred degrees hotter than most
    approximations of its effective temperature. 2. The temperature to
    which a black body radiator must be raised in order that the light
    it emits may match a given light source in color. \[Usually
    expressed in Kelvin (�K).\]
