# Definition

1.  If all the derivatives of a function f(x) are continuous in the
    vicinity of x = a , then f(x) can be expressed in an infinite series
    (the Taylor series): The case a = 0 is called a Maclaurin series. 2.
    The theorem of G.I. Taylor in the statistical theory of atmospheric
    turbulence: where x is the distance traveled by a particle in the
    time interval T ; u is the fluctuation or eddy velocity of the
    particle; and R(ξ) is the Lagrangian correlation coefficient between
    the particle's velocity at time t and t + ξ.
