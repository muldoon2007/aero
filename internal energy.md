# Definition

A mathematically defined thermodynamic function of state, interpretable
through statistical mechanics as a measure of the molecular activity of
the system. It appears in the first law of thermodynamics as du = dq -
dw where du is the increment of specific internal energy, dq the
increment of heat, and dw the increment of work done by the system per
unit mass. The differential du is a perfect differential. Its integral
therefore introduces a constant of integration, the zero-point internal
energy , so that care must be taken when absolute values of the internal
energy are employed.
