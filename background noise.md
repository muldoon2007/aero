# Definition

1.  In recording and reproducing, the total system noise independent of
    whether or not a signal is present. The signal is not to be included
    as part of the noise. 2. In receivers, the noise in the absence of
    signal modulation on the carrier. Ambient noise detected, measured,
    or recorded with the signal part of the background noise. Included
    in this definition is the interference resulting from primary power
    supplies, that separately is commonly described as hum.
