# Definition

Rate of flow of electromagnetic radiation, including: (a) Phase
velocity. The velocity of propagation of surfaces of constant phase.
Strictly, this definition is applicable only to space periodic fields of
infinite length. (b) Group velocity. The velocity of propagation of
electromagnetic radiant energy in a nondispersive or normally dispersive
medium. For a complex waveform, group velocity refers to the velocity of
propagation of the beats between the component frequencies of the
waveform. (c) Signal velocity. The velocity of propagation of a signal.
In a nondispersive or normally dispersive medium, signal and group
velocity are the same. For pure CW (continuous-wave) systems, utilizing
no modulation, phase velocity is applicable. For systems utilizing
modulated CW, signal velocity is applicable.
