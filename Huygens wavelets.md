# Definition

The assemblage of secondary waves asserted by Huygens to be set up at
each instant at all points on the advancing surface of a wave, or phase
front. Many phenomena of wave optics can be neatly explained on this
assumption ( Huygens principle) of the continual creation of new
wavelets and the subsequent destructive or constructive interference
between the wavelets to set up the next-imagined state of the advancing
wave front.
