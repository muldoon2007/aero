# Definition

A set of values describing atmospheric conditions on which ballistic
computations are based: namely, no wind, a surface temperature of 15
degrees C, a surface pressure of 1000 millibars, a surface relative
humidity of 78 percent, and a lapse rate which yields a prescribed
density-altitude relation.
