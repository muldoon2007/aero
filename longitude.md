# Definition

1.  Angular distance, along a primary great circle, from the adopted
    reference point; the angle between a reference plane through the
    polar axis and a second plane through that axis. See coordinate,
    table. Terrestrial longitude is the arc of a parallel, or the angle
    at the pole, between the prime meridian and the meridian of a point
    on the earth, measured eastward or westward from the prime meridian
    through 180 degrees, and labeled E or W to indicate the direction of
    measurement. Astronomical longitude is the angle between the plane
    of the reference meridian and the plane through the polar axis and
    the normal to the spheroid. Geodetic and sometimes astronomical
    longitude are also called geographic longitude. Geodetic longitude
    is used for charts. Assumed longitude is the longitude at which an
    observer is assumed to be located for an observation or computation.
    Difference of longitude at which an observer is assumed to be
    located for an observation or computation. Difference of longitude
    is the smaller angle at the plor or the shorter arc of a parallel
    between the meridians of two places, expressed in angular measure.
    Fictitious longitude is the arc of the fictitious equator between
    the prime fictitious meridian and any given fictitious meridian.
    Grid longitude is angular distance between a prime grid meridian and
    any given grid meridian. Oblique longitude is angular distance
    between a prime oblique meridian and any given oblique meridian.
    Transverse or inverse longitude is angular distance between a prime
    transverse meridian and any given transverse meridian. Celestial
    longitude is angular distance east of the vernal equinox, along the
    ecliptic. Galactic longitude is angular distance east of sidereal
    hour angle 80 degrees, along the galactic equator. 2. Of a planet in
    solar system, the sum of two angles: the celestial longitude of the
    ascending node of the planetary orbit, and the angle measured
    eastward from the ascending node along the orbit to the position of
    the planet.
