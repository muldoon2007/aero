# Definition

The boundary between the troposphere and stratosphere, usually
characterized by an abrupt change of lapse rate. The change is in the
direction of increased atmospheric stability from regions below to
regions above the tropopause. Its height varies from 15 to 20 kilometers
in the tropics to about 10 kilometers in polar regions. In polar regions
in winter it is often difficult or impossible to determine just where
the tropopause lies, since under some conditions there is no abrupt
change in lapse rate at any height.
