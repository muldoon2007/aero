# Definition

Radiation of high penetrating power; that is, radiation of high
frequency and short wavelength. A 10-centimeter thickness of lead is
usually used as the criterion upon which the relative penetrating power
of various types of radiation is based. Hard radiation will penetrate
such a shield; soft radiation will not.
