# Definition

A surface or sheet of discontinuity (i.e., of abrupt changes in
conditions) set up in a supersonic field or flow, through which the
fluid undergoes a finite decrease in velocity accompanied by a marked
increase in pressure, density, temperature, and entropy, as occurs,
e.g., in a supersonic flow about a body. Sometimes called a shock. See
attached shock wave, bow wave, condensation shock wave, detached shock
wave, Mach wave, normal shock wave, oblique shock wave.
