# Definition

A set of mathematical conditions to be satisfied, in the solution of a
differential equation, at the edges or physical boundaries (including
fluid boundaries) of the region in which the solution is sought. The
nature of these conditions usually is determined by the physical nature
of the problem. See boundary-value problem.
