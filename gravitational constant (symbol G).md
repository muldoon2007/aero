# Definition

The coefficient of proportionality in Newton law of gravitation. G =
6.670 +/- 0.005 X 10-8 dyne-centimeter squared per gram squared. Also
called constant of gravitation, Newtonian universal constant of
gravitation. In celestial mechanics, G may be used as a symbol with
units unspecified or in a particular problem may be made equal to 1 or 4
pi squared by the choice of units for other parameters in the particular
problem.
