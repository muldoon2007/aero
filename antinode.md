# Definition

1.  Either of the two points on an orbit where a line in the orbit
    plane, perpendicular to the line of nodes, and passing through the
    focus, intersects the orbit. 2. A point, line, or surface in a
    standing wave where some characteristic of the wave field has
    maximum amplitude. Also called loop . In sense 2, the appropriate
    modifier should be used before the word antinode to signify the type
    that is intended; e.g., displacement antinode, velocity antinode,
    pressure antinode.
