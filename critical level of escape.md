# Definition

That level, in the atmosphere, at which a particle moving rapidly
upwards will have a probability of 1/e, where e is base of natural
logarithm, of colliding with another particle on its way out of the
atmosphere. It is also the level at which the horizontal mean free path
of atmospheric particle equals the scale height of the atmosphere. The
critical level of escape is the base of the exosphere. Also called level
of escape, critical level. See cone of escape, fringe region. Estimates
of the height of the critical level of escape range from about 500 to
1000 kilometers. This large range of estimated values is due primarily
to the general uncertainty about the temperature distribution in the
ionosphere.
