# Definition

In fluid flow, layer next to a fixed boundary. The fluid velocity is
zero at the boundary but the molecular viscous stress is large because
the velocity gradient normal to the wall is large. See turbulent
boundary layer. The equations describing the flow in the laminar
boundary layer are the Navier-Stokes equations containing only the
inertia and molecular viscous terms.
