# Definition

The nondimensional ratio between the product of buoyancy forces and heat
advection and the product of viscous forces and heat conduction in a
fluid. It is written as where g is the acceleration of gravity; ΔzT is a
characteristic vertical temperature difference in the characteristic
depth d ; α is the coefficient of expansion; v is the kinematic
viscosity; and k the thermometric conductivity. The Rayleigh number is
equal to the product of the Grashof and Prandtl numbers, and is the
critical parameter in the theory of thermal instability.
