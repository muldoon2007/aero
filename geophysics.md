# Definition

The physics of the earth and its environment, i.e., earth, air, and (by
extension) space. Classically, geophysics is concerned with the nature
of and physical occurrences at and below the surface of the earth
including, therefore, geology, oceanography, geodesy, seismology,
hydrology, etc. The trend is to extend the scope of geophysics to
include meteorology, geomagnetism, astrophysics, and other sciences
concerned with the physical nature of the universe.
