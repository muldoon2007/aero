# Definition

Angular distance from the geomagnetic equator, measured northward or
southward through 90 degrees and labeled N or S to indicate the
direction of measurement. Also erroneously called magnetic latitude.
Geomagnetic latitude should not be confused with magnetic latitude, the
magnetic dip. Phenomena closely related to the earth's magnetic field
are often plotted according to geomagnetic latitude rather than
geographic latitude.
