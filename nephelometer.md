# Definition

1.  General name for instruments which measure, at more than one angle,
    the scattering function of particles suspended in a medium.
    Information obtained from such instruments may be used to determine
    the size of the suspended particles an the visual range through the
    medium. 2. An instrument for chemical analysis by measuring the
    light-scattering properties of a suspension. 3. = nephometer. See
    visibility meter.
