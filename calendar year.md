The year of the Gregorian calendar, common years having 365 days and
leap years 366 days. Each year exactly divisible by 4 is a leap year,
except century years (1800, 1900, etc.), which must be exactly divisible
by 400 (2000, 2400, etc.) to be leap years. The calendar year is based
on the tropical year. Also called civil year.
