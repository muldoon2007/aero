# Definition

A body of material used to prevent or reduce the passage of particles or
radiation. A shield may be designated according to what it is intended
to absorb, as a gamma-ray shield or neutron shield, or according to the
kind of protection it is intended to give, as a background, biological,
or thermal shield. The shield of a nuclear reactor is a body of material
designed to prevent the escape of neutrons and radiation into a
protected area, which frequently is the entire space external to the
reactor. It may be required for the safety of personnel or to reduce
radiation sufficiently to allow use of counting instruments.
