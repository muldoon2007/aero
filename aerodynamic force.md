# Definition

The force exerted by a moving gaseous fluid upon a body completely
immersed in it. The aerodynamic force is proportional to the expression
p u 2 L 2 R n where p is the fluid density; u is the velocity of the
undisturbed stream relative to the body; L is a characteristic linear
dimension of the body; and Rn is the Reynolds number raised to the power
of n, a constant usually determined experimentally. This form for the
aerodynamic force is sometimes called Rayleigh formula. The component of
the aerodynamic force parallel to the direction of flow is called the
drag.
