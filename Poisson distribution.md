# Definition

A one-parameter discrete frequency distribution giving the probability
the n points (or events) will be (or occur) in an interval (or time) x ,
provided that these points are individually independent and that the
number occurring in a subinterval does not influence the number
occurring in any other nonoverlapping subinterval. It has the form
f(n,x) = e-σx(σx)n/n! The mean and variance are both σx , and σ is the
average density (or rate) with which the events occur. When σx is large,
the Poisson distribution approaches the normal distribution. The
binomial distribution approaches the Poisson when the number of events n
becomes large and the probability of success P becomes small in such a
way that nP aproaches σx.
