# Definition

The frequency at which a charged particle orbits in a uniform magnetic
field. It depends on the charge to mass ratio of the particle times the
magnetic field. While the frequency is independent of the particle
energy, the Larmor orbit increases with energy. Sometimes called the
Larmor frequency. In a magnetic field of 1 gauss, the electron cyclotron
frequency is 2.8 megacycles per second and the proton cyclotron
frequency is 1.5 kilocycles per second.
