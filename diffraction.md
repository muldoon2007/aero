# Definition

The process by which the direction of radiation is changed so that it
spreads into the geometric shadow region of an opaque or refractive
object that lies in a radiation field. Diffraction is an optical edge
effect. Reference to Huygens' principle is a common means of explaining
diffraction. Analysis of the interference between individual Huygens
wavelets which originate in the vicinity of the edge of an irradiated
body reveals that detectable amounts of radiant energy must invade the
nominal shadow zone of the object, and there, by interference, set up
characteristic energy distributions known as diffraction patterns. The
amount of diffractive bending experienced by a ray is a function of
wavelength; thus dispersion occurs, although dispersion is in the
opposite sense to that produced by refraction.
