# Definition

Energy transfer to charged particles in a magnetic field from an
alternating-current electric field whose frequency is equal to the
cyclotron frequency. An analogous physical situation is the large
increase in the motion of a pendulum if it is given a little push in
every period of its natural oscillation. Such a technique is useful in
heating either the electrons or ions.
