# Definition

Of a star, the numerical difference between the apparent photographic
magnitude mpg and the apparent photovisual magnitude mpv or C = mpg -
mpv The color index is zero for class A0 stars of magnitudes between 5.5
and 6.5; it is positive for red stars and negative for bluish stars.
Various other color indices can be formed by using apparent magnitudes
measured in other systems. Thus, the intrinsic color index is apparent
photographic magnitude minus apparent ultraviolet magnitude.
