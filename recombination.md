# Definition

The process by which a positive and a negative ion join to form a
neutral molecule or other neutral particle, also process by which
radicals or dissociations species join to form molecules. Recombination
is applied both to the simple case of capture of free electrons by
positive atomic or molecular ions, and also to the more complex case of
neutralization of a positive small ion by a negative small ion or a
similar (but much more rare) neutralization of large ions. Recombination
is, in general, a process accompanied by emission of radiation. The
light emitted from the channel of a lightning stroke is recombination
radiation as is airglow. The much less concentrated recombinations
steadily occurring in all parts of the atmosphere where ions are forming
and disappearing does not yield observable radiation. The rate at which
electrons, small ions, and large ions recombine is a function of their
respective mobilities and of their concentration. The former dependence
is expressed in terms of the recombination coefficient of the particular
ion type.
