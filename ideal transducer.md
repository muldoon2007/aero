# Definition

For connecting a specified source to a specified load, a hypothetical
passive transducer that transfers the maximum possible power from the
source to the load. In linear electric circuits and analogous cases,
this is equivalent to a transducer which (1) dissipates no energy and
(2) when connected to the specified source and load presents to each its
conjugate.
