# Definition

The fundamental frequency distribution of statistical analysis. A
continuous variety x is said to have a normal distribution or to be
normally distributed if it possesses a density function f(x) which
satisfies the equation where μ is the arithmetic mean (or first moment)
and σ is the standard deviation. Also called Gaussian distribution.
About two-thirds of the total area under the curve is included between x
= μ - σ and x = μ + σ. The corresponding frequency distribution of
vectors is the normal circular distribution in which the frequencies of
vector deviations are represented by a series of circles centered on a
vector mean. When applied to error distribution, this function is the
normal law of errors, and the distribution is called the normal curve of
error.
