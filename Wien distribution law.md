# Definition

A relation, derived on purely thermodynamic reasoning by Wien, between
the monochromatic emittance of an ideal black body and that body's
temperature, Jλ/T5 = f(λ, T) where Jλ is the monochromatic emittance
(emissive power) of a black body at wavelength λ and absolute
temperature T, and f(λ, T) is a function which cannot be determined
purely on classical thermodynamic grounds. Compare Wien law.
