# Definition

The average rate of flow of sound energy for one period through any
specified area. In a medium of density ρ for a plane or spherical free
wave having a velocity of propagation c, the sound energy flux through
the area S corresponding to an effective sound pressure p is J = ( p2S /
ρc ) cos θ where θ = the angle between the direction of propagation of
the sound and the normal to the area S.
