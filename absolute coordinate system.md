# Definition

An inertial coordinate system which is fixed with respect to the stars.
In theory, no absolute coordinate system can be established because the
reference stars are themselves in motion. In practice, such a system can
be established to meet the demands of the problem concerned by the
selection of appropriate reference stars.
