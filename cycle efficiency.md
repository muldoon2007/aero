# Definition

The efficiency of a given cycle in an internal combustion engine, in
producing work, expressed as the useful work output divided by the work
input. For a gas-turbine engine, the cycle efficiency is the useful work
energy less the work required for compression divided by the heat energy
in the fuel used; for a reciprocating engine, it is the energy of the
indicated horsepower divided by the heat energy of the fuel.
