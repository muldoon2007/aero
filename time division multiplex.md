# Definition

A system for the transmission of information about two or more
quantities ( measurands) over a common channel by dividing available
time intervals among the measurands to form a composite pulse train.
Information may be transmitted by variation of pulse duration, pulse
amplitude, pulse position, or by a pulse code. (Abbreviations used are
PDM, PAM, PPM, and PCM, respectively.)
