# Definition

The upper portion of a two-part division of the atmosphere according to
the general homogeneity of atmospheric composition; the layer above the
homosphere. The heterosphere is characterized by variation in
composition and mean molecular weight of constituent gases. See
atmospheric shell. This region starts at 80 and 100 kilometers above the
earth, and therefore closely coincides with the ionosphere and the
thermosphere.
