# Definition

1.  A common boundary between two parts of a system, whether material or
    nonmaterial. 2. Specifically, in a rocket vehicle or other
    mechanical assembly, a common boundary between two components. See
    mating. 3. Specifically, in fluid dynamics, a surface separating two
    fluids across which there is a discontinuity of some fluid property
    such as density or velocity or of some derivative of these
    properties in a direction normal to the interface. The equations of
    motion do not apply at the interface but are replaced by the
    boundary conditions.
