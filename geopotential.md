# Definition

The potential energy of a unit mass relative to sea level, numerically
equal to the work that would be done in lifting the unit mass from sea
level to the height at which the mass is located; commonly expressed in
terms of dynamic height or geopotential height. Compare gravitational
potential. The geopotential Î¦ at height Z is given mathematically by the
expression, where g is the acceleration of gravity.
