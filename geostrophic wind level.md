# Definition

The lowest level at which the wind becomes geostrophic in the theory of
the Ekman spiral, proportional to where v is the kinematic eddy
viscosity and the latitude. Also called gradient wind level. In practice
it is observed that the geostrophic wind level is between 1.2 and 1.6
kilometers, and it is assumed that this marks the upper limit of
frictional influence of the earth's surface. The geostrophic wind level
may be considered to be the top of the Ekman layer and planetary
boundary layer, i.e., the base of the free atmosphere.
