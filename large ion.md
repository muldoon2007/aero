# Definition

An atmospheric ion of relatively large mass and low mobility which is
produced by the attachment of a small ion to an Aitken nucleus. Also
called slow ion, heavy ion, Langevin ion. The ion density of large ions
varies widely, depending upon the degree of atmospheric pollution.
Representative low-altitude values might be 1000 per cubic centimeter in
clean country air, 10,000 per cubic centimeter in an industrial area,
and 100 per cubic centimeter over the oceans.
