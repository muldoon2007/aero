# Definition

In using Doppler radar, the error in the measurement of target radial
velocities due to atmospheric refraction. Compare range error, azimuth
error. These errors result from (a) the assumption of a constant wave
velocity for a nonhomogeneous atmosphere and (b) the refraction or
bending of the rays such that the ray path does not coincide with the
geometrical straight line between the target and the radar. Errors due
to (a) are of no practical importance, and, as in the case of
elevation-angle error, the effects due to (b) are negligible except for
elevation angles near the horizontal.
