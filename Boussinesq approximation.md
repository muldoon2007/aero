# Definition

The assumption (frequently used in the theory of convection) that the
fluid is incompressible except insofar as the thermal expansion produces
a buoyancy, represented by a term gaT (a is equivalent to alpha), where
g is the acceleration of gravity; a is the coefficient of thermal
expansion; and T is the perturbationtemperature.
