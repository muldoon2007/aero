# Definition

An instrument, usually balloon-borne, for the simultaneous measurement
and transmission of meteorological data while moving vertically through
the atmosphere. See dropsonde. The instrument consists of transducers
for the measurement of pressure, temperature, and humidity; a modulator
for the conversion of the output of the transducers to a quantity which
controls a property of the radiofrequency signal; a selector switch
which determines the sequence in which the parameters are to be
transmitted; and a transmitter which generates the radiofrequency
carrier.
