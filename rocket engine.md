# Definition

A reaction engine that contains within itself, or carries along with
itself, all the substances necessary for its operation or for the
consumption or combustion of its fuel, not requiring intake of any
outside substance and hence capable of operation in outer space. Also
called rocket motor. Chemical rocket engines contain or carry along
their own fuel and oxidizer, usually in either liquid or solid form, and
range from simple motors consisting only of a combustion chamber and
exhaust nozzle to engines of some complexity incorporating, in addition,
fuel and oxygen lines, pumps, cooling system, etc., and sometimes having
two or more combustion chambers. Experimental rocket motors have used
neutral gas, ionized gas, and plasma as propellants. See
liquid-propellant rocket engine, solid-propellant rocket engine, ion
rocket, plasma rocket.
