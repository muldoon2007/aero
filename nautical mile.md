# Definition

A unit of distance used principally in navigation. For practical
navigation it is usually considered the length of 1 minute of any great
circle of the earth, the meridian being the great circle most commonly
used. Also called sea mile. Because of various lengths of the nautical
mile in use throughout the world, due to differences in definition and
the assumed size and shape of the earth, the International Hydrographic
Bureau in 1929 proposed a standard length of 1852 meters, which is known
as the international nautical mile. This has been adopted by nearly all
maritime nations. The U.S. Departments of Defense and Commerce adopted
this value on July 1, 1954. With the yard-meter relationship then in
use, the international nautical mile was equivalent to 6076.10333 feet.
Using the yard-meter conversion factor effective July 1, 1959, the
international nautical mile is equivalent to 6076.11549 international
feet.
