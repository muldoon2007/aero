# Definition

A transverse wave in an elastic medium in which the displacement vector
at any point rotates about the point with constant angular velocity and
has a constant magnitude. A circularly polarized wave is equivalent to
two super-posed plane polarized waves of sinusoidal form in which the
displacements have the same amplitude, lie in perpendicular planes, and
are in quadrature.
