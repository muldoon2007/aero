# Definition

A spurious image of an object formed above its true position by abnormal
atmospheric refraction conditions; opposite to an inferior mirage.
Compare towering, looming, inferior mirage. Superior mirages occur when
the temperature lapse rate near the earth's surface is less than its
normal value or, especially, when the temperature actually increases
with height. Under these conditions the velocity of light increases
upward in such a way that light rays are bent downward as they propagate
through the layer in quasi-horizontal directions. The downward curvature
gives the impression that the position of the object viewed is well
above its true position in space. The object also appears inverted.
Complex combination of superior and inferior mirages may occur with
unusual density stratifications.
