# Definition

(From sound fixing and ranging). A system of navigation providing
hyperbolic lines of position determined by shore listening stations
which receive sound signals produced by depth charges dropped at sea and
exploding in a sound channel which is at a considerable depth in most
areas. This system is used in Project Mercury for locating spacecraft
down at sea.
