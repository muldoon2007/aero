# Definition

A direct-current discharge where electrons are forced to oscillate
between two opposed cathodes and are restrained from going to the
surrounding anode by the presence of a magnetic field. It is sometimes
referred to as a pig discharge since the device was originally used as
an ionization gage (Penning ionization gage). It is used as a
plasma-beam source by permitting the plasma to stream out along the
magnetic field through a hole in one of the cathodes.
