# Definition

In meteorology, any condition of the atmosphere which reduces its
transparency to radiation, especially to visible radiation. Ordinarily,
this is applied to a cloud-free portion of the atmosphere that owes its
turbidity to air molecules and suspensoids such as smoke, dust, and
haze, and the scintillation effects.
