# Definition

In radar, a modified A-display in which a target appears as a pair of
vertical deflections or blips instead of a single deflection. When the
radar antenna is correctly pointed at the target in azimuth, the blips
are of equal height. When not correctly pointed, the difference in blip
height is an indication of direction and magnitude of azimuth pointing
error. Also called K-scan, K-scope, K-indicator.
