# Definition

A type of jet engine consisting essentially of a duct or tube of varying
diameter and open at both ends, which admits air at one end, compresses
it by the forward motion of the engine, adds heat to it by the
combustion of fuel, and discharges the resulting gases at the other end
to produce thrust. The ramjet is an athodyd; the pulsejet, especially
the earlier type, is usually not considered an athodyd.
