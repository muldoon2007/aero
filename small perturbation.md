# Definition

A disturbance imposed on a system in steady state, with amplitude
assumed small, i.e., the square of the amplitude is negligible in
comparison with the amplitude, and the derivatives of the perturbation
are assumed to be of the same order of magnitude as the perturbation.
See perturbation, method of small perturbations.
