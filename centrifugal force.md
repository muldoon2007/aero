# Definition

The apparent force in a rotating system, deflecting masses radially
outward from the axis of rotation, with magnitude per unit mass 2R,
where is the angular speed of rotation; and R is the radius of curvature
of the path. This magnitude may also be written as V2/R, in terms of the
linear speed V. This force (per unit mass) is equal and opposite to the
centripetal acceleration. Also called centrifugal acceleration. The
centrifugal force on the earth and atmosphere due to rotation about the
earth's axis is incorporated with the field of gravitation to form the
field of gravity.
