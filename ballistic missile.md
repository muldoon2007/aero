A missile designed to operate primarily in accordance with the laws of
ballistics. A ballistic missile is guided during a portion of its
flight, usually the upward portion, and is under no thrust from its
propelling system during the latter portion of its flight; it describes
a trajectory similar to that of an artillery shell.
