# Definition

A condition characterized by the existence of large water-vapor bubbles
in the intrapleural space between the lungs and the chest wall,
occurring when an unprotected person (or animal) is exposed to ambient
pressures less than 47 millimeters of mercury and water at body
temperature vaporizes from the liquid state.
