# Definition

The ratio of the average energy actually transferred between a surface
and impinging gas molecules which are scattered by the surface to the
average energy which would theoretically by transferred if the impinging
molecules reached complete thermal equilibrium with the surface before
leaving the surface or a = (Er-E i)/Es-Ei) where a is the accommodation
coefficient, Er is the energy carried away from unit surface area per
second by the scattered or re-evaporated molecules, Ei is the energy per
unit surface area per second carried toward the surface by the impinging
molecules, and Es is the energy per unit surface area per second which
would be carried away by the molecules if the molecules reached complete
thermal equilibrium with the surface before leaving.
