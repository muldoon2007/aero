# Definition

The unit of electric current; the constant current which, if maintained
in two straight, parallel conductors of infinite length, of negligible
circular cross sections, and placed 1 meter apart in a vacuum will
produce between these conductors a force equal to 2\*10-7 newtons per
meter of length.
