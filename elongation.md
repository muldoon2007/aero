# Definition

The angular distance of a body of the solar system from the sun; the
angle at the earth between lines to the sun and another celestial body
of the solar system. The term is usually used only in connection with
inferior planets. The greatest elongation of such a body is its maximum
angular distance from the sun before it starts back toward conjunction.
The direction of the body east or west of the sun is usually specified,
as greatest elongation east.
