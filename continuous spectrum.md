# Definition

1.  A spectrum in which wavelengths, wave numbers, and frequencies are
    represented by the continuum of real numbers or a portion thereof,
    rather than by a discrete sequence of numbers. See discrete
    spectrum. 2. For electromagnetic radiation, a spectrum that exhibits
    no detailed structure and represents a gradual variation of
    intensity with wavelength from one end to the other, as the spectrum
    from an incandescent solid. Also called continuum, continuum
    radiation. 3. For particles, a spectrum that exhibits a continuous
    variation of the momentum or energy.
