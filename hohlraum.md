# Definition

In radiation thermodynamics, a cavity whose walls are in radiative
equilibrium with the radiant energy within the cavity. This idealized
cavity can be approximated in practice by making a small perforation in
the walls of a hollow container of any opaque material. The radiation
escaping through such a perforation will be a good approximation to
black-body radiation at the temperature of the interior of the
container.
