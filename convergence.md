# Definition

1.  The contraction of a vector field; also, a precise measure thereof.
    Compare confluence. Mathematically, convergence is negative
    divergence, and the latter term is used for both. (For mathematical
    treatment, see divergence.) 2. The property of a sequence or series
    of numbers or functions which ensures that it will approach a
    definite finite limit. A series representation of a mathematical
    function exhibits convergence if the sum of the terms of the series
    approaches the value of the function more closely as more terms of
    the series are taken, the two agreeing in the limit of an infinite
    number of terms. 3. Decrease in area or volume.
