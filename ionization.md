# Definition

The process by which neutral atoms or groups of atoms become
electrically charged, either positively or negatively, by the loss or
gain of electrons; or the state of a substance whose atoms or groups of
atoms have become thus charged. Ionization is a necessary process to
produce propellant ions in ion engines.
