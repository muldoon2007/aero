# Definition

1.  A broad, high arch of radiance or glow seen occasionally in the
    western sky above the highest clouds in deepening twilight, caused
    by the scattering effect of very fine particles of dust suspended in
    the upper atmosphere. 2. The transient decay of a plasma after the
    power has been turned off. The decay time involved is a direct
    consequence of the charged particle loss mechanisms, such as
    diffusion and recombination. The magnitude of these quantities is
    determined by measuring the decay time under controlled conditions.
