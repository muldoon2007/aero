# Definition

One of the radiation laws which states that the wavelength of maximum
radiation intensity for a black body is inversely proportional to the
absolute temperature of the radiating black body: λm = b/T where λm is
the wavelength of maximum intensity; b is a constant; and T is the
absolute temperature. The Wien displacement constant b is equal to
0.28978 centimeter-degree. Also called Wien displacement law . This law,
established experimentally by Wien in 1896, describes the manner in
which the wavelength of maximum radiation shifts toward shorter values
as the temperature of a radiator rises. It is to be distinguished from
Wien distribution law which describes the variation with temperature of
the intensity of emission at any wavelength. Wien displacement law is
used to compute the color temperature of a radiator by insertion of its
wavelength of peak intensity into the above equation to compute T.
