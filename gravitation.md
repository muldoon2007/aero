# Definition

The acceleration produced by the mutual attraction of two masses,
directed along the line joining their centers of masses, and of
magnitude inversely proportional to the square of the distance between
the two centers of mass. This acceleration on a unit mass has the
magnitude G(m/r2), where m is the mass of the attracting body, r is the
distance between the centers of mass, and G is the gravitational
constant equal to 6.670 +/- 0.005 X 10-8 cm2/gram sec2. In the case of
masses in the earth's gravitational field, m is the mass of the earth,
equal to 5.975 X 1027 grams. However, the rotation of the earth and
atmosphere modifies this field to produce the field of gravity.
