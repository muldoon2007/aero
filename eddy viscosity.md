# Definition

The turbulent transfer of momentum by eddies giving rise to an internal
fluid friction, in a manner analogous to the action of molecular
viscosity in laminar flow, but taking place on a much larger scale. The
value of the coefficient of eddy viscosity (an exchange coefficient) is
of the order of 104 square centimeters per second, or 100,000 times the
molecular kinematic viscosity.
