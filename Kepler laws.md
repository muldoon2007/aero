The three empirical laws governing the motions of planets in their
orbits, discovered by Johannes Kepler (1571-1630). These are: (a) the
orbits of the planets are ellipses, with the sun at a common focus; (b)
as a planet moves in its orbit, the line joining the planet and sun
sweeps over equal areas in equal intervals of time (also called law of
equal areas ); (c) the squares of the periods of revolution of any two
planets are proportional to the cubes of their mean distances from the
sun.
