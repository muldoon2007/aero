# Definition

1.  A measure of the amount of incident radiation which remains in a
    beam after it passes through a unit thickness of a medium. It is
    comparable in concept to the extinction coefficient (or attenuation
    coefficient) and is related to the extinction coefficient σ as
    follows: τ = e -σ where τ is the transmission coefficient. Its
    relationship to transmissivity r is expressed: r = τx where x is the
    total thickness of the medium. Compare absorption coefficient. 2.
    The fraction of the solar radiation normally incident upon the top
    of the atmosphere which survives passage through the atmosphere to
    the earth's surface. As so defined, a better term might be
    atmospheric transmissivity. 3. The ratio of the sound transmitted
    through an interface or spectrum between two media, exposed to the
    sound field, to the sound energy incident on the interface or
    septum.
