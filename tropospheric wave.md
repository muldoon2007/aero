# Definition

A radio wave that is propagated by reflection from a place of abrupt
change in the dielectric constant or its gradient in the troposphere. In
some cases the ground wave may be so altered that new components appear
to arise from reflections in regions of rapidly changing dielectric
constants; when these components are distinguishable from the other
components, they are called tropospheric waves.
