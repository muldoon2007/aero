1.  Of a sound, the time rate at which the sound pressure level (or
    other stated characteristic) decreases at a given point and at a
    given time. A commonly used unit is the decibel per second. 2. Of a
    radioactive nuclide, the number of nuclei of that nuclide changing
    (or disintegrating) per unit time. It is usually expressed as the
    instantaneous rate of decay by - dN/dt where N is the total number
    of the state nuclides present at the given time t.
