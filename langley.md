# Definition

A unit of energy per unit area, equal to 1 gram-calorie per square
centimeter, commonly employed in radiation theory. The langley is almost
always used, in conjunction with some time unit, to express a flux
density; but the time unit has been purposely separated in order that it
may be chosen in a manner convenient to each particular problem. The
unit is named in honor of the American scientist, Samuel P. Langley
(1834-1906), who made many contributions to the knowledge of solar
radiation.
