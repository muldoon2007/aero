# Definition

The electrical force exerted on a unit positive charge at a given point
in space. Electric-field strength is expressed, in the practical system
of electrical units, in terms of volts/centimeter. It is a vector
quantity, being the magnitude of the electric-field vector. Also called
electric field, electric intensity, electric field intensity, electric
potential gradient, field strength. The electric-field strength of the
atmosphere is commonly referred to as the atmospheric electric field.
