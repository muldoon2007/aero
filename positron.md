# Definition

A subatomic particle which is identical to the electron in atomic mass,
theoretical rest mass, and energy, but opposite in sign. Compare proton.
The positron is short lived and can exist only when in motion. When it
combines with an electron, both particles are annihilated and two
photons result, equal in energy to the combined masses of the
annihilated particles. Production of positrons can occur only in pair
formation with the electron, the inverse of the annihilation process.
