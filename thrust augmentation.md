# Definition

The increasing of the thrust of an engine or power plant, especially of
a jet engine and usually for a short period of time, over the thrust
normally developed. The principal methods of thrust augmentation are the
introduction of additional air into the induction system, liquid
injection, and afterburning. With a piston engine, thrust augmentation
usually refers to the direction of exhaust gases so as to give
additional thrust.
