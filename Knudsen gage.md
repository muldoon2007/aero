# Definition

A gage which measures pressure in terms of the net rate of transfer of
momentum by molecules between two surface maintained at different
temperatures and separated by a distance smaller than the mean free path
of the gas molecules. Also called radiometer vacuum gage. Various types
of Knudsen gage are distinguished by the names of the inventors and
differ mainly in the shape and method of suspension of the movable
element.
