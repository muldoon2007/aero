# Definition

A circle on the surface of the earth, parallel to the plane of the
equator and connecting all points of equal latitude, or a circle
parallel to the primary great circle of a sphere or spheroid; also a
closed curve approximating such a circle. Also called parallel of
latitude, circle of longitude. See coordinate, table. An astronomical
parallel is a line connecting points having the same astronomical
latitude. A geodetic parallel is a line connecting points of equal
geodetic latitude. Geodetic and sometimes astronomical parallels are
also called geographic parallels. Geodetic parallels are shown on
charts. A standard parallel is one along which the scale of a chart is
as stated. A fictitious, grid, transverse, incerse, or oblique parallel
is parallel to a fictitious, grid, transverse, inverse, or oblique
equator, respectively. A magnetic parallel is a line connecting points
of equal magnetic dip.
