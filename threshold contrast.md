# Definition

The smallest contrast of luminance (or brightness) that is perceptible
to the human eye under specified conditions of adaptation luminance and
target visual angle. Also called contrast threshold, liminal contrast.
Compare threshold illuminance. Psychophysically, the existence of a
threshold contrast is merely a special case of the general rule that for
every sensory process there is a corresponding lowest detectable
intensity of stimulus, i.e., a limen.
