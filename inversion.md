# Definition

In meteorology, a departure from the usual decrease or increase with
altitude of the value of an atmospheric property; also, the layer
through which this departure occurs (the inversion layer ), or the
lowest altitude at which the departure is found (the base of the
inversion ). This term almost always means a temperature inversion.
