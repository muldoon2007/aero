# Definition

A system in which the (vector) momentum of a particle is conserved in
the absence of external forces. Thus, only in an inertial system can
Newton laws of motion be appropriately applied. When relative coordinate
systems are used, moving with respect to the inertial system, apparent
forces arise in Newton laws, such as the coriolis force.
