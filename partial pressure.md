# Definition

The pressure exerted by a designated component or components of a
gaseous mixture. This may be separately measured in some cases by
suitable selection of gases, traps, or analytical trains. When the
percentage composition of the mixture is known, the partial pressure may
be calculated from the total pressure by Dalton law of partial
pressures.
