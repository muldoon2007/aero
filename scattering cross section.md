# Definition

The hypothetical area normal to the incident radiation that would
geometrically intercept the total amount of radiation actually scattered
by a scattering particle. It is also defined, equivalently, as the
cross-section area of an isotropic scatterer (a sphere) which would
scatter the same amount of radiation as the actual amount. Also called
extinction cross section, effective area.
