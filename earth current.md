# Definition

A large-scale surge of electric charge within the earth's crust,
associated with a disturbance of the ionosphere. Current patterns of
quasi-circular form and extending over areas the size of whole
continents have been identified and are known to be closely related to
solar-induced variations in the extreme upper atmosphere.
