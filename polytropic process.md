# Definition

A thermodynamic process in which changes of pressure p and density ρ are
related according to the formula pρ-λ = p0ρ0-λ where λ is a constant and
the subscript 0 denotes initial values of the variables. Therefore
pressure and temperature are similarly related: p/po = ( T/To ) k where
k is the coefficient of polytropy. For isobaric processes, k = 0; for
isosteric process, k = 1; for adiabatic processes k = cp/R , where c is
the specific heat at constant pressure and R is the gas constant. In
meteorology this formula is applied to individual gas parcels and should
be distinguished from that for a polytropic atmosphere, which describes
a distribution of pressure and temperature in space. See equation of
piezotropy.
