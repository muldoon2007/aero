# Definition

(After Osborne Reynolds (1842-1912), English scientist.) A
nondimensional parameter representing the ratio of the momentum forces
to the viscous forces in fluid flow. In aerodynamics, the Reynolds
number of fluid flow about a body is often expressed as the fraction ρ =
Vl/μ where ρ is the density of the fluid, V is its velocity, l is a
characteristic dimension of the body, and μ is the coefficient of
viscosity of the fluid. See critical Reynolds number, effective Reynolds
number. As applied to the flow of gas through a circular tube the
Reynolds number is a dimensionless quantity equal to the product of the
gas density, ρ , in grams per cubic centimeter; times the flow velocity
v, in centimeters per second; times the tube diameter, d, in
centimeters; divided by the viscosity coefficient μ, in poises: R = ρ
vd/μ
