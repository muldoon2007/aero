# Definition

Glaze aircraft icing (also known as clear icing) is hard and
transparent. It is formed by the relatively slow freezing of supercooled
water droplets as they spread over the surface. It tends to acccumulate
more rapidly than rime icing, and is often very hard and therefore more
difficult to remove. Since it does not freeze instantly, the ice can
form into shapes that cause significant aerdynamic penalties, and it
therefore the most hazardous form of icing. However, it is the least
frequent type of ice encountered, reponsible for about 10% of icing
reports.
