# Definition

An ellipsoid; a figure resembling a sphere. Also called ellipsoid or
ellipsoid of revolution from the fact that it can be formed by revolving
an ellipse about one of its axes. If the shorter axis is used as the
axis of revolution, an oblate spheroid results, and if the longer axis
is used, a prolate spheroid results. The earth is approximately an
oblate spheroid.
