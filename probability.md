# Definition

The chance that a prescribed event will occur, represented as a pure
number P in the range 0\<P\<1. The probability of an impossible event is
zero and that of an inevitable event is unity. Probability is estimated
empirically by relative frequency, that is, the number of times the
particular event occurs divided by the total count of all events in the
class considered.
