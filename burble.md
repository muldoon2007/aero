# Definition

A separation or breakdown of the laminar flow past a body; the eddying
or turbulent flow resulting from this. Burble occurs over an airfoil
operating at an angle of attack greater than the angle of maximum lift,
resulting in a loss of lift and an increase of drag. See compressibility
burble.
