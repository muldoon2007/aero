# Definition

A fictitious exhaust velocity that would theoretically produce the
observed value of jet thrust. The effective exhaust velocity ce is
determined by the equation ce = V + \[A(p1 - p2) g / w\]where V is the
velocity of the exhaust gases; A is the nozzle exit area; p1 is static
pressure at the nozzle exit; p2 is ambient pressure; g is the
acceleration of gravity; and w is the weight flow rate of exhaust gases.
