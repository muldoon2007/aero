# Definition

Magnetism which is retained for long periods without appreciable
reduction, unless the magnet is subjected to demagnetizing force. See
induced magnetism. Because of the slow dissipation of such magnetism, it
is sometimes called subpermanent magnetism, but the expression permanent
magnetism is considered preferable.
