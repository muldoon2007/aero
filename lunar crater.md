A depression, usually circular, on the surface of the moon, usually with
a raised rim called a ringwall. Craters range in size up to 250
kilometers in diameter. The largest craters are sometimes called walled
plains. The smaller, 15 to 30 kilometers across, are often called
craterlets and the very smallest, a few hundred meters across, beads.
Craters are named after people, mainly astronomers.
