# Definition

An orbit in which the satellite revolves about the primary at the
angular rate at which the primary rotates on its axis. From the primary,
the satellite thus appears to be stationary over a point on the primary.
A stationary orbit with respect to the earth is commonly called a
24-hour orbit.
