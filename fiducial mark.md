# Definition

An internally generated identification mark on a film; two or more of
these are generally used for orienting a film for reading, and for
determining the geometric center of the film. The L-shaped corner marks
and the + mark near the picture center, which are on the focal plane of
the Tiros vidicon camera are fiducial marks. Their appearance on the
image permits various calibrations such as determination of the degree
of enlargement needed to fit the picture to the rectification grids,
etc.
