# Definition

1.  In mathematics, the difference between the true value and a
    calculated or observed value. A quantity (equal in magnitude to the
    error) added to a calculated or observed value to obtain the true
    value is called a correction. 2. In a computer or data-processing
    system, any incorrect step, process, or result. In addition to the
    mathematically usage, in the computer field the term is also
    commonly used to refer to machine malfunctions as machine errors and
    to human mistakes as human errors. It is frequently helpful to
    distinguish between these as follows: errors result from
    approximations used in numerical methods; mistakes result from
    incorrect programming, coding, data transcription, manual operation,
    etc.; malfunction result from failures in the operation of machine
    components such as gates, flip-flops, amplifiers, etc.
